Pew really saying Indonesians Muslim The USbased Pew Research Center says recent report nearly half Indonesians want adulterers stoned death thieves hands cut This horrifying finding I doubt accuracy When I read Pew report I could help recall Soe Hok Gie wrote 50 years ago On Oct 20 1961 ChineseIndonesian activist wrote published diary Catatan Seorang Demonstran A Demonstrators Notes asked friend knew Islam statistik He said idea friend told Islam statistik Muslims who pray fast They simply exist counted statistics Gie referring many nominal Muslims across Indonesia home worlds largest Muslim population In colloquial terms called Islam KTP Islam abangan The term abangan used celebrated American anthropologist Clifford Geertz seminal work The Religion Java define group Javanese Muslims favored local customs mixture Islam Hinduism animism instead Islamic law sharia From colonial times early 1990s majority Indonesian Muslims seldom depicted devout observant According many orientalists studying Indonesian Islam centuries nominal abangan Muslims dominated countrys political cultural spheres Such notion widely accepted prompted British historian William Roff accuse Western colleagues trying reduce diminish role Islam Indonesia Writing Archipel 1985 Roff suggested there seemed strange desire foreign researchers diminish conceptually place role religion culture Islam past Southeast Asian society It therefore baffling read conclusion Pew study states 72 percent Indonesian Muslims want sharia law replace existing Criminal Code colonial legacy remained largely intact decades It shocking told 45 percent Indonesians supportive stoning cruel sadistic corporal punishments All sudden told majority Indonesians Muslim radicals There must something wrong survey If must something horribly wrong Indonesians Having raised Muslim studied Indonesian Islam State Islamic University UIN I believe want believe survey flawed The academic debate observant Indonesian Muslims always boils researchers define Islamic orthodoxy could moot point Social scientists mostly agree Indonesian Muslims different many Middle Eastern counterparts differ whether makes Indonesians less Muslim say people Afghanistan The Pew study admitted though Muslims approved sharia agree sharia meant implemented It possible people interviewed Pew idea talking Most Indonesians understand Arabic access key literature Islamic law let alone opportunity study Even understand questions I doubt 1880 respondents interviewed Pew center telling truth Indonesians want publicly seen bad Muslims even though probably neglect many basic Islamic rituals Muslim obliged perform It possible said supported sharia thought say even though mean In reality based election results majority Indonesians vote Islamic parties likely think turning Indonesia Islamic state bad idea These people probably abhor US backing Israel Middle East also eager watch Iron Man 3 theaters weekend According observations Indonesian Muslims eclectic comes practicing faith The Koran condemns kind attitude I seeing It much easier example find Muslim pray five times day find Muslim eats pork Eating pork probably considered far greater sin skipping prayer And I think Muslim women opt wear hijab veil good scriptural argument back decision Muslim feminists claim They wear hijab simply want Since colonial times never popular movement strong enough push implementation sharia country The colonial advisers native affairs mainly Snouck Hurgronje right thing suggested creation religious courts Muslims settle civil matters according Islam application European legal system deal crimes Indonesian Muslims apparently fine The last time revised Criminal Code 49 years ago I aware perhaps Indonesians become religious religious fundamentalism probably thriving But say Indonesians want sharia made the official law land Pew suggests bit farfetched I could wrong naive doubting prestigious pollster I find hard imagine least 4 10

proposed Abdurrahman Gus Dur Wahid context cultural Islamic movement Indonesia referred indigenization Islam This idea remains relevant four years Gus Durs demise Dec 30 2009 amid rise Islamism Islamic formalization efforts country However relevant idea preventing religious radicalism I argue idea indigenization Islam may indeed answer religious understanding contextual rigid enough provide solution problem Islamic radicalism This religious radicalism solely emerging group puritanical religious understanding A group like Salafi example also seeks purify doctrine ignoring local elements regarded heretical Yet clearly show apolitical stance According Olivier Roy professor political Islam group referred neofundamentalists seek enforce public morality without intention changing political institutions especially means violence However term apolitical actually categorizes supporters political regimes endorse religious legitimacy policies There also aspects must considered analyzing Islamic radicalism emerges The strengthening Islamic radicalism Indonesia government deals elements Islamic movement Without local context Islamic political ideas imported outside contain biases Arabism flourish Indonesia This also true apolitical Salafi groups tend supported government To put simply puritanical Islamic movement show without local context allows accepted This clearly observable experience New Orders political history political Islamic movements marginalized ranging banning Masyumi former senior figures political activities cooptation Islamist parties formation United Development Party PPP bloody events Tanjung Priok massacre 1984 Organized Islam considered dangerous communism although elements Muslims played important role eliminating communism beginning New Order era Nevertheless silencing political Islamic aspirations regime led radical forms reaction underground movements Some examples cases observed include bombing Borobudur two branches Bank Central Asia case Warman terror Komando Jihad well Garuda plane hijacking Bangkok 1981 Therefore expression religious radicalism must also understood reaction political pressure regime perceived Soeharto enemy must fought Mohammed Hafez 2003 Sidel 2007 book Why Muslims Rebel Repression Resistance Islamic World states the cumulative effect political repression exclusive organizations antisystem ideology protracted conflict secular ruling regime ordinary civilians perceived sustaining regime The rise radical Islamic movement fall Soeharto thus also understood result treatment regimes considered favoring policy the Global War Terrorism echoed US government adopts security approach dealing religious radicalism Comparative observations countries Pattani Muslim group Thailand well Abu Sayyaf group Philippines also provide similar explanation regarding development religious radicalism The first example relates violent means used Islamic groups Pattani Thailand associated repression regime Thaksin Shinawatra entrusted military crush Islamic movement right beginning reign Second minority Muslim movement Moro Philippines seeking free Philippines repressive actions regime In addition conflict Moro also product historical construction colonial regime As result political pressures regime led cases political economic marginalization facilitates proliferation puritanical religious understanding In context religious understanding seen providing ammunition criticize oppose oppressive regime In contrast religious understanding Islamic cultural groups considered likely accommodating less critical regime In addition contiguity issues global Islamic solidarity Afghanistan Palestine Philippines Myanmar established belief real oppression Muslim world therefore needs take fight However religious radicalism reaction stated Sidel 2007 symptoms actually indicate weakness fragmentation radical Islamic movement rather strength solidity Therefore overreaction sees religious radicalism threat social integration actually irrelevant deliver counterproductive solution To conclude excessive political pressure use security approach deradicalization efforts democratic era fact similar methods used Soeharto political Islamic movement Thus understanding Islamic radical actors changed adaptable local context indigenization Islam treatment regime repressive state apparatuses also changed persuasive offensive The writer lecturer sociology Jakarta State University alumnus Ciganjur Islamic boarding school Give Islamic syariah law chance Mujahidin leader The Jakarta YOGYAKARTA JP Some 1500 Muslims held first Indonesian MujahidinCongress Yogyakarta Aug 5 Aug 7 resulted establishment Mujahidin Assembly document named Yogyakarta Charter The Mujahidin defenders faith claim group says Congress gathering concerned people It attracted attention Congress raised issue applying syariah Islamic law interpretation uniform among Muslims Applying syariah Yogyakarta Charter says way multidimensional crisis Amid similar calls ongoing Annual Session People Consultative Assembly Charter recommended Assembly modify Clause 29 1945 Constitution freedom religion obliging Muslims adhere syariah The Congress also wants statement added forward preamble Constitution specifically phrase Belief OneGod The phrase among five points state ideology Pancasila mentioned preamble The requirement Muslims adhere Islamic law known seven words dropped earlier version Pancasila called Jakarta Charter following heated debates 1945 The Constitution introduction years considereda taboo subject change The Mujahidin Assembly comprises 36 members different groups includes noted scholars Deliar Noer Mawardi Noor Ali Yafie Jakarta Alawy Muhammad Madura Ahmad Syahirul Amin Yogyakarta To help explain Mujahidin demands The Jakarta Post talked Irfan S Awwas chairman congress organizing committee initiator congress Estimated cost Rp 650 million said congress received donations parties would identify including Muslims Sweden Germany Australia besides fees Rp 50000 per participant Now publisher chief editor banned Arrisalah monthly magazine Yogyakarta served nine years 11year prison sentence subversion He released 1993 married three children Excerpts interview Question Why congress demand adoption Jakarta Charterinto Constitution already recognizes freedom religion Answer The requirement Muslims apply syariah give us right apply daily lives This means government longer reasons forbid us 1980s instance women complained banned superiors school authorities wearing headscarf Ed Besides Jakarta Charter result national consensus among Muslim nonMuslim political figures August 1945 It baseless provocation inclusion seven words wouldmake several provinces break away Republic words finally omitted Yet proven separation East Timor demands Irian Jaya Aceh religion It injustice received years central government Why Congress decide application syariah way crisis including threat disintegration Muslims majority Indonesia If syariah applied nonMuslims would forced practice It Pancasila every organization obliged New Order government adopt one basic principle statutes So would reason disintegration You free practice religion If disharmony involving different religions occurs invite involved parties sit together discuss matter What task Mujahidin Assembly Would task MPR government agreed demands The assembly alliance different components Its task ensuring syariah upheld Muslims Indonesia world Through Assembly Muslim experts would discuss problems Muslims face make decisions The main objective establishment khilafah one leadership Muslims world similar Prophet era We wantto one leader unite world Muslims If Catholicshave Pope Vatican example people suspicious Muslims want establish similar leadership Muslims need international leader call amirul mukminin leader Muslims We soon try convince society especially Muslims syariah create better life awarded nobility God eyes We plan set representative offices 20 provinces They task realizing Assembly programs We also invite mujahidin countries One recommendation congress replacement Criminal Code syariah Is possible considering Indonesians Muslims There need nonMuslims worry application syariah positive law It harm Islam fully guarantees freedom followers religions practice whatthey believe The Koran clearly forbids followers force anyone tobecome Muslim Islamic law prevails Moslems Therefore nonMuslims committed wrong doings would automatically judged according Islamic law laws according religions They could even given chance choose law want use This happened Prophet Mohammed era following eras khilafah Muslim leadership So application syariah would nt threat nonMuslims That right This understood many Yet since secular people always provoking us always fear among nonMuslims discriminated syariah applied In fact thing never happened history Islam History showsthat Muslim majority never oppressed nonMuslims What mostly happened opposite How view efforts turning Indonesia Islamic state I think understandable Muslim prefers Islamic state Yet main goal Our concern guarantee application syariah regardless form state It would mean nothing Islamic state syariah upheld would I suggest people never use old paradigm suspicion link every activity Muslims effort build Islamic nation Doing avoid conflicts We honest Muslims long mistreated I believe Muslims treated way harm community Muslims Indonesia always reactive They anything harmful unless harmed first Actually three different perceptions among Muslims struggling application syariah They jamaah community power daulah setting Islamic state khilafah leadership If Indonesia accept syariah positive law especially Muslims need establish Islamic state I repeatedly said main point application syariah It must much easier accept presently since many Indonesian elite Muslims We never given chance explain reduce nonMuslims suspicion possibility discrimination syariah applied Just give us chance prove Muslims protect nonMuslims long treat us enemies course History proven Therefore I assure far I observed strategy revolution establish Islamic state We channel demands Islamic parties organizations bid uphold Islamic syariah What thoughts led congress It emerged concern toward present condition one isproposing Islam solution Muslims majority And manyothers share view Therefore invited sharing vision mission uphold syariah congress organizing committee eventually formed There fact three reasons thought congress beheld First ideological Every Muslim expect syariah upheld obligatory The second historical For 700 years since Prophet Mohammed era fall Khilafah Usmaniah toppled Mustafa Kemal Attaturk Turkey 1924 Muslims accepted syariah Muslims practiced one leader known amirul mukminin Yet since 1924 present Muslims longer practice syariah Among indications fact many Muslims longer accept syariah easily say impossible apply days As result many Allah commands prohibitions seem inapplicable days The third reason reality We witnessed crisis tragedy nonMuslims proposed solutions Yet Muslim organization group done Why It religion given proper role That also religion especially Indonesia could never function way Just look adultery It rife nowadays despite fact religions forbid thing Even existing law punish asthey mutual pleasure without anyone forcing In particular case state law seems teaching religions The reasons motivated us handle problems using Islamic point view We believe Islam capable handling crisis government give Islam chance say History shows Islam experience It naive say Islam system government system leadership given

Government  Gan said Comparing ideologies PKS Malaysia PAS The To compare two Islamic political parties Southeast Asia PKS Indonesia Prosperous Justice Party PAS Malaysia Pan Islamic Party interesting Several reasons put forward justify comparison First unlike radical groups try enforce Islamic law streets PKS PAS use constitutional process follow democracy rules game establishing Islamic political parties Second PKS PAS played significant roles bringing political change Indonesia Malaysia Although PKS new party Indonesia many describe solid Indonesia clean wellorganized image The newly established party gained 14 percent vote 7 seats House Representatives 1999 general election time still called Justice Party After changed name required legislation failed win minimum 25 percent vote PKS won 73 percent votes 45 seats House Meanwhile PAS opposition party Malaysia since establishment 1951 powerful Kelantan Trengganu states In 1999 elections PAS won statelevel control Kelantan Trengganu However suffered embarrassing losses 2004 election popularity Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi Third PKS PAS widely believed identical Islamic parties Islamic agenda objectives However parties programs strategies responses Islam state similar From historical perspective one argue parties influenced Islamic movements Middle East especially Egypt well Pakistan The ideological influence Ikhwanul Muslimin Muslim Brotherhood movement led Hasan alBanna Egypt easily found parties strategies programs pronouncements For alBanna founding father Muslim Brotherhood Muslim world decline symbolized acceptance Western forms government Thus believed Muslims return Islamic values Returning Islam implied establishment Islamic state according alBanna The tarbiyah education movement model cornerstone PKS clearly influenced methods Muslim Brotherhood used recruit members According alBanna basic unit organization cell family The main role family unit tarbiyah education dakwa propagation This tarbiyah model popular among Muslim students leading universities Indonesia 1990s adopted PKS recruit members The influence Middle Eastern ideology also found PAS According Safie Ibrahim book The Islamic Party Malaysia Its Formative Stages Ideology 198174 PAS ideology heavily influenced JamaatiIslami movement Pakistan Ikhwanul Muslimin movement Egypt However although PKS PAS share similar ideologies imported Brotherhood movement also significant differences particularly regards views Islamic state PAS positions opposition party often oppressed government Meanwhile PKS established soon fall Soeharto 1998 means party never experienced Soeharto iron fist Looking current political platforms objectives two parties clear enough different orientations regards relationship Islam state On one hand PAS since establishment stated establishing Islamic state main objective In Kelantan see Islamic law enacted state level The PKS hand never clearly stated far final objective establishment Indonesian Islamic State Thus understandable last two elections 1999 2004 pointed Greg Fealy Anthony Bubalo work Joining Caravan The Middle East Islamism Indonesia 200570 PKS emphasized secular themes fighting corruption socioeconomic equality need continued political reform instead Islamic state issues However say PKS leaders abandoned earlier commitment Islamist causes The question therefore arises PKS PAS apparently different orientations strongly influenced Ikhwanul Muslimin movement clearly states fighting establishment Islamic state compulsory It could argued real sociopolitical situations prevailing Indonesia Malaysia respectively lead different orientations As established opposition party federal system easier PAS fight objectives state level If PAS becomes successful ruling party state level easier try implement concept Islamic state The PKS hand still struggling Indonesia unitary rather federal state Indonesia also presidential system That PKS hesitant proclaim opposition party say establishment Islamic state main objective We know would happen PKS become ruling party would Indonesian Islamic state main goal Finally would interesting parties hold discussions share information respective ideologies manifestos Would possible PAS follow adopt PKS strategy attracting Muslim voters Malaysia emphasizing secular issues Or conversely could PKS learn

could offer valuable lessons Arab Spring countries facing similar challenges The debate relationship Islam democracy rests Islamic doctrine also history Essentially democracy system governance sovereignty lies hands people But many say contradicts doctrine Islam insists sovereignty belongs God Advocates line thinking put forward three arguments First fundamentally different view nation ummah The view nation modern democracy tied physical space marked territorial geographical borders On hand Islam understanding nation bounded borders aqidah basic tenets Islam Therefore many Muslims nation defined faith geography Second Muslim scholars see democracy worldly value spiritual goals primary importance Democracy thus becomes secondary goal Third contradiction arises peoples sovereignty lies heart democracy absolute meaning people ultimate holders power Laws regulations decided people representatives God But scholars peoples sovereignty absolute since bound laws Islam In Islam Gods sovereignty absolute These three interpretations used Muslims reject democracy However many Muslims take opposite view arguing democracy inherent people line Islamic teachings They base argumentation Islamic doctrines  justice freedom deliberation equality  espouse basic principles democracy At level Islam speak procedural system basic soul spirit democracy If interpretation democracy existence certain social political ideals like freedom thought faith opinion equality law would seem contradiction guaranteed Islam There several cultural factors however slowed growth democracy Islamic countries Middle East First strong monolithic paradigm thought Islam Such paradigm stems Middle Eastern Muslims limited understanding Islams nature essence regard Koran Hadith regard history Islam often viewed divine instrument understanding world perception prompted Muslims believe Islam offers complete way life kaffah According understanding Islam allencompassing system belief offers solution problems This view Islam perfect comprehensive number implications If Islam transformed use level political ideology political practice could lead political belief Islam must become states basis existence Islamic jurisprudence must accepted states constitution sovereignty would lie hands God In short context perspective modern political system rule people direct conflict Islam Second absence democracy Middle East could also explained weak political regimes accommodate democracy Leadership long based family ties regimes would lose prerogative Third ironic thing absence democracy Middle East often tacit support Western world  US particular  existence authoritarian regimes The US seemed care less whether Middle Eastern autocracies developed democratic character able secure Americas various economic imperialistic interests This nothing nature Islam obvious West particularly United States always fully step exhortations promote democracy globally Of special note however fact absence democracy countries Middle East feature wider Muslim world Indonesia example seen much success transition authoritarian regime democratic system governance While Indonesia still

Masyumi Nahdlatul Ulama took second 2092 percent third 1841 percent place respectively Sukarnos Indonesian Nationalist Party PNI 2232 percent Collectively however gained 4393 percent votes Considering
