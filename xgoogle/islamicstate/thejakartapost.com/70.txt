Canadian warplanes launch first airstrike in Iraq | The Jakarta PostCanadian warplanes involved in the U.S.-led bombing campaign against militants in Iraq have launched their first airstrikes since deploying to the region.

A statement from Defense Minister Rob Nicholson's office on Sunday said two fighter jets attacked targets in the vicinity of Fallujah with laser-guided bombs and safely returned to their base in Kuwait. Few other details were immediately released.

Canada has deployed six CF-18s along with a C-150 Polaris and two CP-140 Aurora surveillance aircraft as its contribution to the bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria. About Canadian 600 airmen and airwomen are involved.

Following a request from the U.S., Canada's Parliament voted last month to authorize the airstrikes. The motion authorized air strikes in Iraq for up to six months and explicitly stated that no ground troops be used in combat operations.

Canada is among dozens of countries that have joined the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group.
