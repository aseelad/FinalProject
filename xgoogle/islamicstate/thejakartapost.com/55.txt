Indonesia sends 17 Muslim students to Southern Thailand | The ...Indonesia's Religious Affairs Ministry has sent 17 Muslim students from Islamic boarding schools across the country to Southern Thailand as part of an exchange program with the Southern Border Province Administrative Center (SBPAC), Thailand.

The ministry's boarding school education spokesperson Mohammad Zen said on Friday that the 17 students — who hailed from boarding schools like Al Masuria in Sukabumi (West Java), Al Kautsar in Batam (Riau Islands), Qomarul Huda in Lombok (West Nusa Tenggara), Darul Amal in Metro Lampung (Lampung) and Al Ittifaq in Bandung (West Java) — were scheduled to undertake three-year agribusiness programs at six colleges across Southern Thailand.

Zen explained that the 17 students would be entitled to scholarship allowances worth 54,000 Thai baht or about US$1,678 per year, adding that the student exchange program was a follow-up from an agreement between the ministry and the SBPAC that was inked at the Princess of Naradhiwas University in Thailand in September 2013.

"From Thailand, the SBPAC sends several students to study in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs at several Indonesian universities, including the State Islamic University of Jakarta and in Yogyakarta," he said as quoted by Antara news agency.

The Indonesian students left for Thailand on Thursday after undergoing a cultural orientation program at the Thai Consulate in Jakarta and receiving intensive language training from a Thai exchange student, Arphandee, at the State Islamic University of Jakarta. (hhr)
