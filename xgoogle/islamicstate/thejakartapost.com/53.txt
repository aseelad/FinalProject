Comments on other issues: Indonesia struggles with IS recruiting ...Oct. 6, Online/AP



A businessman who proclaims himself leader of the Indonesian chapter of the Islamic State (IS) says he has personally overseen the departure of scores of fighters to Syria and Iraq. Police recently detained him for a night, but were unable to charge him with a crime.



Your comments: 



IS is challenging all Muslim countries with cries of “Are you real Muslims? Are you with us or are you apostates?” 



IS is clearly causing a rift between fundamentalists and those who follow a reformed Islam appropriate to life in the 21st century.  



It is obvious in Indonesia that there are many fence-sitters, those not sure which way they should go.



The ultimate choice is whether you want to live in the seventh century or the 21st century.  



The overwhelming mass of humanity will opt for the 21st century.

IS does a disservice to Islamic world with their behavior.

There will always be some people that are Kharijites and want to takfir (accuse a fellow Muslim of apostasy) like IS members, and who want to shed the blood of other Muslims. 



This clearly is not Islam and why the vast majority of those who are Islamists around the world have rejected IS, which is not Islamic based on what they do. 



God will judge everyone according to their deeds, even the deeds of those who just sit there watching what is happening while wondering what to do.
