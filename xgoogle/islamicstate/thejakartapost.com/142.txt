Govt monitoring Malaysian IS members intent on returning to spread ...The government and police are keeping a close eye on Malaysian Islamic State (IS) fighters who are planning to return to the country to spread their extremist ideologies.

Deputy home minister Wan Junaidi Wan Jaafar said police are aware that these militants had the intention to spread their beliefs to people here.

"They are not coming home to surrender themselves to the authorities, rather to influence people with their ideologies.

"The police are aware of the matter and will take appropriate action," said Wan Junaidi in reply to a question by Dr Marcus Mojigoh in Parliament on Monday.

Earlier, Wan Junaidi said that 39 Malaysians had been identified over their involvement with IS, however he refused to divulge further information with regard their backgrounds.

"I can however say none of the 39 are from Sabah or Sarawak," said Wan Junaidi in reply to Johai Abdul. (***)
