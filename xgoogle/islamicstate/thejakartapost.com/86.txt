Bekasi NU says no official role at Islamic congress | The Jakarta PostThe Bekasi branch of Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) said Tuesday the organization had never approved a joint declaration made during a recent Islamic congress in the city and an NU member at the event attended in an informal capacity.



NU Bekasi chapter chairman Zamakhsyari Abdul Majid said the organization had been invited to attend the congress but finally decided not to send a representative. 



"There was a [Bekasi] NU vice chairman who came to the congress, but it was because he also holds position as an official with the local chapter of the lndonesian Ulema Council (MUI)," he said.



"The organizer and participants of the congress then may have misidentified him as a representative from NU."



Zamakhsyari made the statement in response The Jakarta Post's article published Tuesday, which reported that the organization, along with several other local Islamic groups, participated in a Islamic congress in Bekasi earlier this month.



The congress recommended that sharia law be implemented in Bekasi and that a joint mission be established to eradicate the ongoing "Christianization" of the city.
