U.S. Says It Stopped 3 Young Women Seeking to Join Islamic State ...DENVER — Three teenage girls from the Denver suburbs traveling to Syria to join militants from the Islamic State were intercepted by American law enforcement authorities at a German airport over the weekend and returned to their families, federal law enforcement officials said on Tuesday.

The young women, described in news reports as two sisters of Somali descent and a friend of Sudanese descent, were reported missing by their families on Friday. One family said they had taken their passports and $2,000 from home, according to the Arapahoe County sheriff’s office, which said the families had no knowledge of why the teenagers had left.

The sheriff’s office described them as 15- and 17-year-old sisters and a 16-year-old from another family.

Federal law enforcement officials said one teenager had apparently become inspired to join the Islamic State group and had coaxed the other two to follow. After receiving reports about their disappearance, officials detained them at the international airport in Frankfurt and brought them back to Denver.

The authorities in the United States have stepped up their efforts to stem the flow of Americans trying to join militant groups in Syria and in corners of Iraq controlled by the Islamic State. At least a handful of recruits appear to be young women who marry militants or work as battlefield nurses or in other support roles.

It is unclear whether the three young women will face any criminal charges. Suzie Payne, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.'s Denver office, said they were “safe and reunited with their parents.”
