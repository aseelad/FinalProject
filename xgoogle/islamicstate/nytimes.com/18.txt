Unesco Condemns Destruction of 11th-Century Shrine in Iraq ...Islamic extremists have destroyed an important 11th-century shrine in Iraq, in a continuation of their war on cultural sites they consider idolatrous, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known as Unesco.

Unesco did not name Islamic State as being responsible for the destruction of the shrine, which it identified as the Imam Dur Shrine in Salahuddin Province, north of Baghdad.

But researchers who are tracking the widespread destruction of heritage sites in Syria and Iraq blamed the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

Irina Bokova, Unesco director-general, said in a news release that the destruction of the shrine was not an isolated case. “The intentional targeting and systematic destruction of cultural heritage in Iraq is reaching unprecedented levels,” she said, calling such acts “cultural cleansing” and “war crimes.”

“Over the past months, we have witnessed similar attacks on historical buildings, in particular mosques, churches and shrines,” she said.

Unesco said the shrine – which consisted of a square main building topped with a tall dome — was “one of the emblematic representations of Islamic architecture of its time.”

In Iraq and Syria, Sunni extremists like the Islamic State and others are deliberately wrecking shrines, statues, mosques, tombs and churches — anything they regard as idolatry.

In a speech at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in late September, Secretary of State John Kerry warned about the destruction of heritage sites in Syria and promised action.

Sam Hardy, an antiquities researcher in London, said the Iraqi shrine was destroyed on Oct. 23.

He said another important loss recently was a shrine belonging to the minority Yazidi sect in Sinjar, which he said had been destroyed by militants.
