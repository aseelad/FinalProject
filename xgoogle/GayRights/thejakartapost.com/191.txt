JIS ambiguous about data on teachers, commission says | The ...The Indonesian Child Protection Commission (KPAI) says the management of Jakarta International School (JIS) has not been forthcoming about information on students and teachers, which is needed for further investigation into the alleged rape of one of its pupils.

“Just the same as yesterday, JIS hasn’t been transparent,” said KPAI commissioner Putu Elvina at the Jakarta Police headquarters on Thursday, as quoted by Antara.

Elvina voiced hope that the JIS management would help police investigate the case. She said the school’s transparency in providing necessary data would be helpful for the police in uncovering and pursuing other suspects in the case.

“If JIS could be more cooperative there would likely be a list of suspects,” she said.

Elvina went on to say that JIS had provided different information to that provided by the parents of the victim.

Investigators from the Jakarta Police also intend to investigate claims of negligence made against the school. Rights groups have voiced suspicion that the alleged rape of the 6-year-old kindergartner was caused by negligence on the part of the school.

The police will also prosecute the JIS foundation for operating a kindergarten without a permit from the Education and Culture Ministry. The school allegedly violated Article 71 of Law No. 20/2003 on the national education system.

On April 21, the Education and Culture Ministry decided that kindergartners in the 2013-2014 academic year could attend the school until the academic year ended, but prohibited the kindergarten from accepting new pupils for the next academic year. (put/ebf)
