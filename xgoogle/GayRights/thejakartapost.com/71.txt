Incumbent Komnas HAM commissioners survive early selection ...Five incumbent rights commissioners have survived the early stages in the selection process for the next tenure, despite the current leadership of the human rights body being widely criticized for lacking credibility.

Chairman of the selection committee for the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), Jimly Asshiddiqie, said that the five incumbents were qualified to pass to the third phase of selection, along with 115 other contenders.

“The selectors have a scoring system to determine which applicants will proceed. Based on the five incumbents’ knowledge and experience, they deserve to remain in the running,” the former Constitutional Court chief told the press on Wednesday.

The first qualification stage comprised the administrative requirements. In February, the committee received 363 applications, of which only 276 met the requirements.

For the second phase, the committee selected 120 names out of the 276 applicants based on their views on human rights issues in the country.

The 120 contenders will go on to be judged on their physical condition, written papers and interviews during the third stage of the selection process.

The incumbent commissioners who made their way to the third stage are Hesti Armiwulan, Johny Nelson Simajuntak, Kabul Supriyadhie, Nur Kholis and Yosep Adi Prasetyo.

Other contenders vying for the commission’s leadership include activist and land rights researcher Sandra Moniaga, human rights activist Sandyawan Sumardi, former law and human rights director general Hafid Abbas, gay rights activist Dede Oetomo, transgender activist Yulianus ‘Mami Yuli’ Rettoblaut, and Taufik Basari from the Legal Aid Institute for the Community (LBH Masyarakat).
