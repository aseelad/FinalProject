FPI usually talks with Gerindra before rallies, says party official | The ...Gerindra Party official Fajar Siddiq regretted the recent Islam Defenders Front (FPI) rally that turned violent, saying that the violence was unnecessary and would have been avoidable if the hardline group had spoken with Gerindra Party officials first, as they normally do before such events.

Fajar said the FPI would always talk with them first before hitting the streets.

“That is why I am confused. Why didn’t they do that this time?” Fajar said Saturday, as quoted by kompas.com.

He added that everything would have run smoother and there would have been no violence, had the FPI come and talked to them first. He said he suspected that there were agents provocateur who wanted to defame both the FPI and Muslims by turning the peaceful rally into a violent one.

On Friday afternoon, the FPI demonstrated in a bid to express its rejection of Deputy Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent who will replace outgoing Governor and president-elect Joko Widodo, who is a Muslim of Javanese descent.

The rally turned into a violent confrontation against police personnel after hundreds of protesters bearing FPI banners threw stones and rocks at the council building. More than 10 police officers were injured -- two were rushed to hospital -- while a number of cars were also damaged during the protest. (alz/dic)
