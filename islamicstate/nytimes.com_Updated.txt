accounts least half gray hairs The Tea Party claim half But chance spend hour touring horizon White House Map Room late Friday afternoon its clear president take world born many lessons last six years feisty answers foreign policy critics Obama made clear going involve America deeply places like Middle East extent different communities agree inclusive politics victorno vanquished The United States going air force Iraqi Shiites faction Despite Western sanctions cautioned President Vladimir Putin Russia could invade Ukraine time trying find way back cooperative functioning relationship Russia remainder term much difficult Intervening Libya prevent massacre right thing Obama argued without sufficient followup ground manage Libyas transition democratic politics probably biggest foreign policy regret At end day president mused biggest threat America  force really weaken us  us We many things going us right country  new energy resources innovation growing economy  said never realize full potential unless two parties adopt outlook were asking Shiites Sunnis Kurds Israelis Palestinians No victor vanquished work together Our politics dysfunctional  said president heed terrible divisions Middle East warning us societies dont work political factions take maximalist positions And diverse country less afford take maximalist positions While blamed rise Republican far right extinguishing many potential compromises Obama also acknowledged gerrymandering Balkanization news media uncontrolled money politics  guts political system today  sapping ability face big challenges together foreign enemy Increasingly politicians rewarded taking extreme maximalist positions  said and sooner later catches you I began asking whether former Secretary State Dean Acheson present creation postWorld War II order wrote Obama feel present disintegration  First I think cant generalize across globe bunch places good news keeps coming Look Asia said countries like Indonesia many countries Latin America like Chile But I believe  added that were seeing Middle East parts North Africa order dates back World War I starting buckle But wouldnt things better armed secular Syrian rebels early kept US troops Iraq The fact said president Iraq residual US troop presence would never needed Shiite majority squandered opportunity share power Sunnis Kurds Had Shia majority seized opportunity reach Sunnis Kurds effective way passed legislation like deBaathification  outside troops would necessary Absent troops sooner later would caught crossfire argued With respect Syria  said president notion arming rebels would made difference always fantasy This idea could provide light arms even sophisticated arms essentially opposition made former doctors farmers pharmacists forth going able battle wellarmed state also wellarmed state backed Russia backed Iran battlehardened Hezbollah never cards Even president said administration difficulty finding training arming sufficient cadre secular Syrian rebels Theres much capacity would hope The broader point need stay focused  added is disaffected Sunni minority case Iraq majority case Syria stretching essentially Baghdad Damascus Unless give formula speaks aspirations population inevitably going problems Unfortunately period time Shia majority Iraq didnt fully understand Theyre starting understand Unfortunately still ISIL Islamic State Iraq Levant I think little appeal ordinary Sunnis But theyre filling vacuum question us simply counteract militarily going speak Sunni majority area right detached global economy Is Iran helpful I think Iranians done  said president is finally realize maximalist position Shias inside Iraq long term going fail And thats way broader lesson every country You want 100 percent notion winner really take spoils Sooner later governments going break down The states well like Tunisia Ive argued done factions adopted principle victor vanquished Once didnt need outside help We unwilling  said president factions Iraq Our military capable put everything keep lid problem time But society function long term people make decisions going live together going accommodate others interests going compromise When comes things like corruption people leaders hold accountable changing cultures We help partner every step way But cant them So I asked explain decision use military force protect refugees ISIL also known ISIS Kurdistan island real decency Iraq When unique circumstance genocide threatened country willing us strong international consensus people need protected capacity obligation  said president But given island decency Kurds built also ask added how push back ISIL also preserve space best impulses inside Iraq much mind mind throughout I think Kurds used time given troop sacrifices Iraq  Obama added They used time well Kurdish region functional way would like see It tolerant sects religions way would like see elsewhere So think its important make sure space protected broadly Ive indicated I dont want business Iraqi air force I dont want get business matter Kurdish air force absence commitment people ground get act together whats necessary politically start protecting push back ISIL The reason president added that start taking bunch airstrikes across Iraq soon ISIL came would taken pressure Prime Minister Nuri Kamal alMaliki That would encouraged said Maliki Shiites think We dont actually make compromises We dont make decisions We dont go difficult process figuring weve done wrong past All let Americans bail us And go business usual  The president said telling every faction Iraq We partners going Were sending bunch US troops back ground keep lid things Youre going show us willing ready try maintain unified Iraqi government based compromise That willing continue build nonsectarian functional security force answerable civilian government We strategic interest pushing back ISIL Were going let create caliphate Syria Iraq know weve got partners ground capable filling void So were going reach Sunni tribes were going reach local governors leaders theyve got sense theyre fighting something Otherwise Obama said We run ISIL certain period time soon planes gone theyre coming right back in I asked president whether worried Israel It amazing see Israel become last several decades  answered To scratched rock incredibly vibrant incredibly successful wealthy powerful country testament ingenuity energy vision Jewish people And Israel capable militarily I dont worry Israels survival I think question really Israel survive And create State Israel maintains democratic civic traditions How preserve Jewish state also reflective best values founded Israel And order consistently belief find way live side side peace Palestinians You recognize legitimate claims land neighborhood well Asked whether vigorous pressing Israels prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Palestinian Authoritys president Mahmoud Abbas also known Abu Mazen reach landforpeace deal president said start Prime Minister Netanyahus poll numbers lot higher mine were greatly boosted war Gaza  Obama said And doesnt feel internal pressure its hard see able make difficult compromises including taking settler movement Thats tough thing With respect Abu Mazen its slightly different problem In ways Bibi strong ways Abu Mazen weak bring together make kinds bold decisions Sadat Begin Rabin willing make Its going require leadership among Palestinians Israelis look beyond tomorrow And thats hardest thing politicians take long view things Clearly lot presidents attitudes Iraq grow turmoil unleashed Libya NATOs decision topple Col Muammar elQaddafi organize sufficient international followon assistance ground help build institutions Whether getting back Iraq newly Syria question Obama keeps coming back Do I partners  local andor international  make improvements engineer selfsustaining Ill give example lesson I learn still ramifications day  said Obama And participation coalition overthrew Qaddafi Libya I absolutely believed right thing Had intervened its likely Libya would Syria And would death disruption destruction But also true I think European partners underestimated need come full force youre going Then its day Qaddafi gone everybody feeling good everybody holding posters saying Thank America At moment much aggressive effort rebuild societies didnt civic traditions So thats lesson I apply every time I ask question Should intervene militarily Do answer day   Obama Lead UN Effort Halt Movement Terror Recruits WASHINGTON
