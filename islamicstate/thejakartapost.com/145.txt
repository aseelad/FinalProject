Comments: PKB gives Islamic edge to Jokowi | The Jakarta PostMay 4, p2



Presidential hopeful Joko “Jokowi” Widodo received a major boost in his efforts to woo Muslim voters as he moved closer to forming an alliance with the National Awakening Party (PKB), currently the country’s largest Islamic-based party. Senior PKB officials confirmed the party’s decision to collaborate with the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), saying it was “just a matter of time” before the parties made the partnership official.

Well, if the PDI-P needs to choose an Islamic party to align with, I am happy they chose the PKB. Hopefully Gus Dur’s philosophy still lingers within the party.

It is true, the first leader of the PKB and former president Gus Dur also said so. The PKB even attracts non-Muslim voters. The PKB is very different from the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) and we should appreciate its presence.

Why would Jokowi or anyone want to close down the country’s moderate Islam-based political party with close ties to the world’s largest Muslim organization?
