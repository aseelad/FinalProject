Hizbut Tahrir denounces HKBP, demands Islamic state | The Jakarta ...Hundreds of Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia members rallied at the Hotel Indonesia traffic circle in Central Jakarta on Thursday to support a regulation on houses of worship and implementation of sharia.

 

The hard-line Islamic group activists unfurled posters to denounce followers of Batak Christian Protestant Church (HKBP) for failing to comply with a joint ministerial decree on development of places of worship, which requires a congregation to seek approval from local people’s consent if they wish to build a house of worship.



“HKBP commits treason against the state,” read posters displayed by the Muslim group activists.



The demonstrators asked the government to strictly implement the decree so as to avoid conflicts between people from different faiths in the country.



An attack on HKBP leaders in Bekasi, West Java on Sept. 12 has sparked a controversy over whether the decree is needed or not in the country which claims to uphold religious tolerance and mutual respect. 



The Hizbut Tahrir activists also renewed calls for implementation of sharia and formation of an Islamic state, despite the fact that the People’s Consultative Assembly has declared the pluralistic state of Indonesia already final. The demonstrators said minority groups would be protected under an Islamic state.
