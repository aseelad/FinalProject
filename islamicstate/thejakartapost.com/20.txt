Police: Group aimed to make RI an Islamic state by force | The ...During interrogation, a recently arrested terrorism suspect said his group was aiming to build an Islamic country through military force, National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Edward Aritonang said Thursday.



Edward said the statement was obtained from Ubaid, one of the terrorist suspects arrested in Aceh and now in police custody. Ubaid said the military training facility had been established to provide human resources to transform Indonesia into an Islamic state by military force, he said.



“Ubaid has admitted that the [group’s] strategy was different to the bombs used by [the late] Noordin M. Top and [the late] Dr. Azahari Husein.”



Ubaid’s testimony also showed that the terrorist’s grand plan was to make Aceh part of the Qoidah Aminah, meaning it would serve as a base to launch attacks on those working to prevent the group from turning Indonesia into an Islamic state, Edward said.
