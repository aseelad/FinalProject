President discusses IS after arrest of 4 foreigners | The Jakarta PostPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono summoned a number of ministers on Sunday to discuss the development and dynamics of the Islamic State (IS) organization, also known as ISIS, following the arrest of four foreigners in Central Sulawesi on Saturday.

"The agenda of todayâ€™s [Sunday] meeting is to discuss what we need to do related to the development and dynamics of ISIS, which has become a topic at the international level," he said as quoted by Antara news agency.

He said it would be better for Indonesia to be proactive in offering solutions to stop violence, wherever it came from.

The President also appreciated the efforts of the police, who he said had foiled attempts to launch violent actions.

He called on all parties not to get carried away and be ever vigilant, as violence could happen not only in the Middle East but also at home.

Those attending the meeting included Coordinating Political, Legal and Security Affairs Minister Djoko Suyanto, Coordinating People's Welfare Minister Agung Laksono, Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa, Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro, Home Minister Gamawan Fauzi, Religious Affairs Minister Lukman Hakim Saefuddin, Indonesian Military (TNI) chief Gen. Moeldoko, National Police chief Gen. Sutarman and National Intelligence Agency (BIN) chief Lt. Gen. Marciano Norman.

The police arrested four foreigners thought to hail from Chinese Turkestan, and three Indonesians believed to have connections with IS, in Parigi Moutong, Central Sulawesi.

The foreigners, identified as AB, A, AB and AJ, were flown to Jakarta on Sunday morning. (nvn)
