KALYAN: In an awareness drive to deter youths from being radicalized and recruited by terror outfits, the Kalyan police are using the example of the four local youths who are desperate to be rescued from the violent war being fought by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and brought back home.The police have requested parents to tell their children about the ordeal undergone by Arif Majeed, Aman Tandel, Fahad Shaikh and Sahim Tanki, and keep tabs on their phones and social media usage."We have requesting parents to become their children's friends and talk to them, and also keep a watch on them as youngsters easily get influenced by unverified news on the social media," said an officer from Bazarpeth police station.Some parents suggested that the police should ban controversial content on social media and keep tabs on those spreading such messages. "They should take concrete steps against social media as it has become a platform for miscreants to influence youths," said Haji Arafat from Bail Bazar.In May, the four youths had left for Iraq with a group of pilgrims, but disappeared. Later they had reportedly called up their relatives in Kalyan to say that they had joined the ISIS.
