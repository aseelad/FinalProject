LONDON: UK Prime Minister David Cameron on Wednesday ruled out paying ransom to secure the release of a British hostage being held by ISIS militants.Speaking in the House of Commons, Cameron stressed that the UK will not "waver" in its aim to defeat terrorism and that every possible option will be considered to protect the British man even as he condemned the "barbaric" beheading of a second US hostage."There is no doubt in my mind that the many tens of millions of dollars that ISIS (IS) have raised from ransom payments is going into promoting terrorism including terrorism affecting our own country," he said.IS terrorists threatened to kill a British hostage in a video of US journalist Steven Sotloff's death unless US air strikes in Iraq are stopped.The British hostage has family in Scotland but relatives do not want him named.British Prime Minister David CameronAn IS video posted online two weeks ago showed the killing of another US journalist, James Foley.The British hostage appears at the end of the latest video, released yesterday and titled 'A Second Message To America'.The US has confirmed the video is authentic.Asked if Britain will try to "extricate" the British hostage, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond referred to the previous failed attempt to rescue him."You are aware of course of the rescue attempt that took place some time ago, unfortunately unsuccessfully. You wouldn't expect me to discuss the various options we will be considering, but I can assure you we will look at every possible option to protect this person," he said.Video grab of US journalist Steven Sotloff being beheaded by ISIS militantUS President Barack Obama said on Wednesday that the United States will not be intimidated by Islamic State militants after the beheading of a second American journalist and will build a coalition to "degrade and destroy" the group.Obama still did not give a timeline for deciding on a strategy to go after the extremist group's operations in Syria. "It'll take time to roll them back," the president said at a news conference during a visit to Europe.Obama's comments came after he said the United States had verified the authenticity of a video released on Tuesday showing the beheading of freelance reporter Steven Sotloff, two weeks after journalist James Foley was similarly killed.Obama vowed the US would not forget the "terrible crime against these two fine young men.""Our reach is long and justice will be served," Obama said.In the Sotloff video, a masked militant warns Obama that as long as US air strikes against the militant group continue, "our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."Obama responded that he will continue to fight the militant threat and the "barbaric and ultimately empty vision" it represents."Our objective is to make sure that ISIL is not an ongoing threat to the region," he said, using an acronym for the militant group. "And we can accomplish that. It's going to take some time and it's going to take some effort."Sotloff, a 31-year-old Miami-area native who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished a year ago in Syria and was not seen again until he appeared in the video that showed Foley's beheading. Dressed in an orange jumpsuit against an arid Syrian landscape, Sotloff was threatened in that video with death unless the US stopped air strikes on the Islamic State.In the video distributed Tuesday and titled "A Second Message to America," Sotloff appears in a similar jumpsuit before he is apparently beheaded by a fighter with the Islamic State, the extremist group that has conquered wide swaths of territory across Syria and Iraq and declared itself a caliphate.British foreign secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC on Wednesday that the masked, British-accented jihadist appears to be the same person shown in the Foley footage.In the video, the organization threatens to kill another hostage, this one identified as a British citizen, David Cawthorne Haines. It was not immediately clear who Haines was.Last week, Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, pleaded with his captors for mercy, saying in a video that her son was "an innocent journalist" and "an honorable man" who "has always tried to help the weak."Obama said the prayers of the American people are with the family of the "devoted and courageous journalist" who deeply loved the Islamic world and whose "life stood in stark contrast to those who murdered him so brutally.""Whatever these murderers think they will achieve by murdering innocents like Steven, they have already failed," Obama said. "We will not be intimated. Their horrific acts only unite us."State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Tuesday that it is believed that "a few" Americans are still being held by the Islamic State. Psaki would not give any specifics, but one is a 26-year-old woman who was kidnapped while doing humanitarian aid work in Syria, according to a family representative who asked that the hostage not be identified out of fear for her safety.
