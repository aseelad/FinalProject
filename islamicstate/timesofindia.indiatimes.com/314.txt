Syria almost lost its second city to the jihadists of ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra on Monday night when hundreds of fighters stormed into the provincial capital, Idlib, captured the newly installed governor's office and began beheading Syrian army officers. By the time government troops recaptured the building, at least 70 soldiers — many senior officers — had been executed, leaving one of the oldest cities in Syria in chaos. 



 "They were slaughtered," a message to Damascus said before the army was able to declare Idlib saved. The eastern city of Raqqa has been in the hands of ISIS for months, but Idlib lies strategically placed between Aleppo and the coastal city of Latakia — both of which are still held by President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Idlib's fall would have been a devastating blow to the government. 



 At one point, the Assad administration was told the city had fallen after police and security officers in the headquarters of governor Kheir Eddib Asayed defected to the rebels. Many did, in fact, surrender the building. But by chance soldiers on the city's perimetre did not receive this news and continued to fight hundreds of jihadis trying to break into Idlib. They were still holding off the attackers when the governor's office was recaptured.The independent
