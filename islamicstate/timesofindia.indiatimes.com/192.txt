LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron vowed on Sunday that Britain would do all it could to catch the killers of a British aid worker beheaded by the Islamic State, which he condemned as an "act of pure evil".In its third beheading of a western hostage in less than a month, Islamic State (ISIS) released a video late Saturday showing the execution of Briton David Haines and threatening the life of another British captive.As President Barack Obama offered US support for its "ally in grief", Cameron faced growing calls at home to commit Britain's military to Washington's planned assault against the jihadist group that has seized parts of Syria and Iraq.US secretary of state John Kerry was in Paris to push for a broad international coalition against ISIS, which has already secured the backing of 10 Arab states including Saudi Arabia.The bid was boosted on Sunday by Australia's announcement that it was deploying 600 troops to the region to join the effort against what Prime Minister Tony Abbott called a "murderous death cult".France is hosting an international conference on Iraq on Monday, and President Francois Hollande's office said the "heinous killing" of Haines was another reason why a global push against ISIS was needed.A still image taken from a purported Islamic State video of British captive David Haines before he is beheaded.

We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination."We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region," he said.US President Barack Obama condemned as a "barbaric murder" the slaying of British aid worker David Haines by Islamic State.
