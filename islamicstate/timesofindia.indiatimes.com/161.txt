LONDON: Amnesty International has said it has credible new evidence to confirm that Islamic State militants are carrying out a wave of ethnic cleansing against minorities in northern Iraq.The human rights watchdogs have said that IS had turned the region into "blood-soaked killing fields".Among the ethnic and religious minorities being targeted in northern Iraq are: Assyrian Christians, Turkmen Shi'a, Shabak Shi'a, members of the Yezidi faith, Kakai and Sabean Mandaeans.Many Arabs and Sunni Muslims known or believed to oppose IS have also been targeted in apparent reprisal attacks.Amnesty said that the group that calls itself the Islamic State (IS) has carried out ethnic cleansing on a historic scale in northern Iraq.IS has systematically targeted non-Arab and non- Sunni Muslim communities, killing or abducting hundreds, possibly thousands, and forcing more than 830,000 others to flee the areas it has captured since June 10, 2014.A new Amnesty report said "Ethnic and religious minorities have lived together in the Nineveh province; today, only those who were unable to flee remain trapped there, under threat of death if they do not convert to Islam. Hundreds, possibly thousands, of Yezidis most of them women and children from the Sinjar region were abducted as they fled the IS takeover in early August"."Some of those who managed to make contact with their families said they are being pressured to convert to Islam and some have reported that some of the women and children - both girls and boys - from their families were taken to unknown locations by their captors. Some families say their detained relatives have also told them there have been cases of rape and sexual abuse of detained women and children," the report added.The UN earlier announced it was sending a team to Iraq to investigate "acts of inhumanity on an unimaginable scale"."The massacres and abductions being carried out by the Islamic State provide harrowing new evidence that a wave of ethnic cleansing against minorities is sweeping across northern Iraq," said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's Senior Crisis Response Adviser currently in northern Iraq."The Islamic State is carrying out despicable crimes and has transformed rural areas of Sinjar into blood-soaked killing fields in its brutal campaign to obliterate all trace of non- Arabs and non-Sunni Muslims."One man who gave Amnesty International a list of 45 names of missing relatives - all of whom are women and children said: "We get news from some of them but others are missing and we don't know if they are alive or dead or what has happened to them".
