LONDON: The wife of British aid worker Alan Henning, held hostage by the Islamic State group, said on Tuesday she had received an audio message from him pleading for his life.

Henning, a 47-year-old Manchester taxi driver, was kidnapped last December while in Syria. He first appeared at the end of an ISIS video that showed the beheading of a fellow British captive, David Haines."An audio file of Alan pleading for his life has just been received by me," Barbara Henning said in a statement released via Britain's foreign office. She once again sent out a plea to Henning's captors to release him."I and people representing me continue to reach out to those holding Alan," she said. "Islamic State continues to ignore our pleas to open dialogue. I have seen Muslims across the globe question Islamic State over Alan's fate. The voices of the people have spoken out loud and clear. He was working with Muslims to help the most vulnerable within Syria. Nothing has changed. He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid."Barbara said she was at a loss to understand why those leading Islamic State continued to threaten her husband's life. "I have been told that he has been to a sharia court and found innocent of being a spy and declared to be no threat," she said. "I implore Islamic State to abide by the decisions of their own justice system. Please release Alan."Earlier in the day, Henning's brother-in-law said he feared the recent US-led air strikes against Isis could make it harder to find and rescue the hostage. "It does scare me," Colin Livesey said. "Because if they're going to do air strikes on them, they'll just run away. They'll take him with them and no one will know where he is again. Time will tell if it's worked. I don't want to lose the faith in knowing he's coming home".
