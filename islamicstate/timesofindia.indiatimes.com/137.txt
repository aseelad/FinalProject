WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama says the United States will wage a military campaign that will target Islamic State fighters with airstrikes "wherever they exist."

He's indicating the US will expand its air campaign across the Iraqi border to Islamic State targets in Syria.

Obama will deliver a major address on Wednesday evening laying out his plan to deepen the US military role in the Middle East.

In excerpts released in advance, Obama says the US will lead a broad coalition to degrade and then destroy the Islamic State.

Obama says the campaign won't involve US combat troops on the ground. He says it's different from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and mirrors US counterterrorism efforts in Yemen and Somalia. The US has launched drone strikes in those countries for years.
