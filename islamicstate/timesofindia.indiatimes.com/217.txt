NEW DELHI: The government is looking sympathetically into the request made by the father of a

youth allegedly recruited by the Islamic State, seeking facilitation of his rescue. Sources in the security establishment said intelligence agencies have begun to explore ways to get 23-year-old

KalyanAreebMajid"Our agencies are in touch with their counterparts in Turkey, where Majid is said to have fled after escaping from ISIS territory, to look out for him and negotiate the possibility of his rescue and return to India," a senior officer in the security establishment told TOI.Incidentally, it remains to be seen how Majid, who now reportedly claims to have been "misled" into joining ISIS, can be rescued and reunited with his family without facing legal action for having been associated with a UN-proscribed outfit. India is bound by convention as well as its own anti-terror law to act against outfits proscribed by the United Nations."Provided that Turkish authorities are convinced that Majid was merely misled by ISIS ideology propagated through the net and realized his mistake before he could indulge in any terror-related activity, there is an even chance of them agreeing to hand him over to the Indian authorities," said an officer.There is a feeling in the Indian security establishment that a positive response to Majid's father's request, conveyed to the Mumbai office of the National Investigation Agency ( NIA), may help publicize the futility of young Indians being influenced by jihadi campaign unleashed by global terror outfits on the net. "It can be a major boost to our efforts at counter-radicalization of young Muslims," said an intelligence official.Incidentally, all four Kalyan youth that had in May joined a religious tour and travelled to Iraq to fight along with ISIS, have got in touch with their families, conveying their despair over life under ISIS and expressing desire to come back home. However, Indian agencies feel it may be far more difficult to rescue the Indians holed up in ISIS-controlled territory as there is no idea how to reach them there and who to contact to facilitate their return.
