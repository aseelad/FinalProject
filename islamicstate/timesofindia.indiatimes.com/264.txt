Saudi top cleric blasts Qaida, IS as 'enemy No. 1' of Islam

RIYADH: Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh on Tuesday blasted al-Qaida and Islamic State jihadists as "enemy number one" of Islam, in a statement issued in Riyadh. 



 "The ideas of extremism, radicalism and terrorism ... have nothing to do with Islam and (their proponents) are the enemy number one of Islam," the kingdom's top cleric said. 



 He cited jihadists from the Islamic State, which has declared a "caliphate" straddling parts of Iraq and Syria, and the global al-Qaida terror network.
