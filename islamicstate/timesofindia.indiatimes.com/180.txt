LONDON: The terrorist group â€” Islamic State (ISIL) may have now got their hands on fighter jets and are being trained to fly them.Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State are training its members in Syria to fly three captured fighter jets, according to a UK-based activist group that monitors the conflict.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo.At present, the Western military forces led by US and UK have been using air power to push back ISIL. The latest development comes as a major worry for the coalition forces.SOHR said on Friday, "Reliable resource reported to SOHR that ISIL now own three warplanes that can fly with pilots being taught high level manoeuvre tactics. These warplanes are expected to be MIG 21 and 23. Officers from the Iraqi dissolved army, who are also members in the Islamic State Organization, have overseen the training of some militants in order to be able to lead these aircrafts."A file photo of Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 fighter jet (AFP photo)SOHR further revealed that the training courses are being given in the airbase of Al Jarrah known also as the Kshish airbase.This airbase located in the eastern countryside of Aleppo and considered the most important camp for IS in Syria.SOHR said, "The people who live in the nearby areas of the airbase of al Jarrah informed SOHR activists that they saw a warplane taking off from the airbase and flying at a low altitude over the area. It is worth mentioning that it is not the first time that the people witnessed an aircraft flying at a low altitude. The same resources informed SOHR activists that IS fighters seized these aircrafts after taking control over the military airports affiliated to the regime forces in Aleppo and al Raqqa provinces."SOHR however added that their sources have not confirmed whether ISIL owns missiles for these aircraft.
