DENVER: The FBI said on Tuesday that it's investigating the possibility that three girls from the Denver area tried to travel to Syria to join Islamic State extremists.An FBI spokeswoman says agents helped bring the girls back to Denver after stopping them in Germany. Spokeswoman Suzie Payne says they're safe and have been reunited with their families.She didn't identify the girls or provided other details.The announcement comes one month after 19-year-old Shannon Conley of Arvada, Colorado, pleaded guilty to charges that she conspired to help militants in Syria.The US attorney's office in Denver declined to comment on the latest cases. It's unclear whether the girls will face charges.Crimes committed by juveniles are treated as acts of "delinquency" in the federal system and are not handled the same way as crimes committed by adults.Authorities have not said how the girls became interested in helping the Islamic State group. In Conley's case, she told agents she wanted to marry a suitor she met online who said he was a Tunisian man fighting with the Islamic State in Syria.Conley said she wanted to use her American military training with the US Army Explorers to fight a holy war overseas, authorities said. If she could not fight with the extremists, she told agents, she would use her training as a nurse's aide.Agents, who had been overtly trying to stop Conley, arrested her in April as she boarded a flight she hoped would ultimately get her to Syria. She could face up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine when she is sentenced in January.Foreign fighters from dozens of nations are pouring into the Middle East to join the Islamic State group and other terrorist organizations. US officials are putting new energy into trying to understand what radicalizes people far removed from the fight, and into trying to prod countries to do a better job of keeping them from joining up.
