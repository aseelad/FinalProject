NEW DELHI: While intelligence agencies have expressed concern over some Indian youths going to Syria and Iraq to fight along the Islamic State (IS), earlier known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), home minister Rajnath Singh on Friday played it down saying Muslims in India are fiercely opposed to the outfit and its ways."There is no progress in ISIS recruitment in the country. All Muslim organizations have condemned the outfit and its ways in India. Everybody wants communal harmony in the country to continue. The approach of Islamic organizations in the country has been very positive as far as the issue of ISIS is concerned," Singh told a press conference when asked about the government's concern over ISIS recruiting from India.When Singh was further prodded that Indian youths joining ISIS was a reality that could not be ignored and that even families of some of these youths had met the home minister, Singh said, "At that time there was such information. But no such thing is happening now."The statements assume significance in the light of Indian security agencies expressing concern over the development even as families of such youths asked Singh during a meeting last month that the government should do something to stop impressionable Muslim youths from getting radicalized.The statement is also being seen as Singh's attempt to assure Muslims that the government would not be guided by presumptive and religion-coloured arguments on terrorism. It is also an acknowledgement of the fact that the growing threat of jihadi terror can only be fought with cooperation from the Muslim community.Some 20-30 youths from India belonging to various states such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are suspected to have been inspired by IS' ultra-right ideology and are known to be fighting alongside the outfit in the Syria-Iraq theatre.The home ministry had earlier issued advisories to all states to keep a watch on tensions developing between Shias and Sunnis after widespread atrocities on Shias at the hands of IS were reported from Iraq.
