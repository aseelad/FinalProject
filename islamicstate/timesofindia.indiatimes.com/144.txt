BAGHDAD: Kurdish fighters backed by US warplanes pushed back jihadists around Iraq's largest dam on Sunday, as Sunni Arab tribesmen and security forces fought the militants west of Baghdad.Two months of violence have brought Iraq to the brink of breakup, and world powers relieved by the exit of divisive premier Nouri al-Maliki were sending aid to the hundreds of thousands who have fled their homes as well as arms to the Kurds.Kurdish fighters were advancing on Mosul dam, which the Islamic State (IS) fighters seized a week ago, but their progress was being hampered by roadside bombs, Kurdish officials said.The dam on the Tigris river north of Iraq's second city provides electricity and irrigation water for farming to much of the region.It recapture would be the first major prize won back from the jihadists since they launched their shock offensive in early June, routing the security forces across much of northern and western Iraq.The Mosul dam.

"They are heading towards Tal Kayf, but the main road was planted with roadside bombs," he added.Another Kurdish official, Harim Kamal Agha, said the bombs planted by the retreating jihadists were slowing the advance.The US military said it carried out nine air strikes on Saturday in support of Kurdish forces.US Central Command said warplanes and drones had destroyed or damaged four armoured personnel carriers, seven armed vehicles, two Humvees and an armoured vehicle.Buoyed by the air strikes US President Barack Obama ordered last week, Kurdish forces have tried to claw back the ground they have lost since the start of this month, when the jihadists went back on the offensive north, east and west of Mosul.In Anbar province, west of Baghdad, security forces backed by Sunni Arab tribal militia, who threw their weight behind a counter-offensive against the jihadists on Friday, made gains west of the provincial capital Ramadi, police said.This image taken from a video released by Welayat Nineveh media office on August 9, 2014, shows Islamic State jihadists waving their trademark flag as they inspect the grounds of the Mosul dam. (Via AFP)Fighting was also taking place near the strategic Euphrates Valley town of Haditha, which hosts another important dam, Police Staff Major General Ahmed Sadag said.The rallying of more than two dozen Sunni tribes to the government side marked a potential turning point in the fightback against the jihadists and their allies.The militants were able to sweep through the Sunni Arab heartland north and west of Baghdad in June, encountering little effective resistance, and Iraqi federal security forces have yet to make significant headway in regaining ground.Anbar was the birthplace of the Sahwa, or Awakening, movement of Sunni tribes that from late 2006 sided with US forces against their co-religionists in al-Qaida, helping turn the tide of that insurgency.In the north, members of minority groups including the Yazidis, Christians, Shabak and Turkmen, remain under threat of kidnapping or death at the hands of the jihadists, human rights groups said.An Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighter monitors the area from their frontline position in Bashiqa, a town 13 kilometres northeast of Mosul on August 16, 2014.
