The Islamic State (IS) militant group executed a total of 17 Syrians over the past three days in the country's eastern province of Deiral-Zour 



 The terror group's fighters either beheaded or crucified the 17 people in different cities in the oil-rich Deir al-Zour on different charges, such as being snitches to the government forces, or members of anti-IS militants, Xinhua quoted the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights as saying. 



 The IS has become in control over large swathes of Deir al-Zour, which is close to the Iraqi borders. The extremist group has imposed strict rule in Deir al-Zour and its de facto capital of al- Raqqa in northern Syria.
