LONDON: As many as 60 British women have joined an all-female sharia police unit for the Islamic State (ISIS), reprimanding those who fall foul of the jihad's strict rules.The al-Khansaa Brigade is believed to be operating in the Syrian city of Raqqa, which is controlled by ISIS jihadists and works as their Syrian headquarters.According to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium (TRAC), the militia group was established earlier this year to help expose male activists who attempt to disguise themselves in women's clothing to avoid detention.A prominent figure in the police force, according to the UK-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR), is Aqsa Mahmood, a privately-educated Glaswegian 20-year-old who fled to Syria last November.Most of the British women who have travelled to the war torn region to fight, are between the ages of 18 and 24, Daily Telegraph reports, a further three of whom are believed to have joined the military unit.Aqsa Mahmood.

I believe that's why at least four of them have been chosen to join the women police force."The identities of the other three women are current unknown, however a small contingent of female Britons have flown over to the region to fight in some capacity.Twin 16-year-old sisters Zahra and Salma Halane left their Manchester home on 26 June to join the conflict — it is believed they married ISIS militants, with terrorist chiefs investigating whether the men paid for their travel.Muslim convert Sally Jones, a mother of two from Kent, is also believed to have fled to ISIS from her life in the UK after meeting a computer hacker turned jihadi online and later marrying him.A Syrian air strike targeting an ISIS stronghold in Raqqa killed at least 25 people on Saturday — most of whom were civilians, with nine ISIS fighters dead. Activists say the missile hit a crowded bakery.
