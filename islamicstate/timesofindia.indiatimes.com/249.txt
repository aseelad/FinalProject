KIRKUK (Iraq): Iraqi government troops and allied militiamen launched a major operation on Tuesday to retake the city of Tikrit from Sunni jihadists of Islamic State, senior officials said."The Iraqi army and (Shia) volunteers, backed by Iraqi helicopters, are taking part" in the operation to retake the hometown of executed former president Saddam Hussein, a high-ranking army officer told AFP.Earlier on Tuesday, Iraqi forces launched a string of attacks on Sunni militants as US President Barack Obama declared his firmest commitment yet to targeting jihadists.Kurdish and federal forces, who wrested back control of the country's largest dam, battled jihadists in the country's north, buoyed by intensifying US air strikes and western arms deliveries.Other security forces backed by militiamen and tribesmen meanwhile launched strikes against the jihadists at numerous flashpoints north, west and south of Baghdad, officials said.Kurdish peshmerga fighters guard a position on front line of fighting with ISIS jihadists 20 kilometres east of Mosul, on August 18, 2014.

"If they continue to do so, they will have the strong support of the United States of America," he promised, in his clearest signal yet that the 10-day-old US air campaign was far from over.US and other officials have repeatedly stressed that military cooperation between the Kurds and Baghdad was essential to any successful counter-offensive but their alliance remained uneasy.A handout picture released by United Nations high commissioner for refugees on August 19, 2014, shows three newborns sleeping in a neonatal intensive-care unit at a hospital in Qamishly, northeastern Syria.

In the north, members of minority groups including Christians, Yazidis, Shabak and Turkmen, remain under threat of kidnap or death at the hands of the jihadists, rights groups say.Amnesty International, which has been documenting mass abductions in the Sinjar area, says ISIS fighters have kidnapped thousands of Yazidis in this month's offensive.
