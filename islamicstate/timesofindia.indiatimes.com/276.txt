BAGHDAD: Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a militant group that witnesses and officials say has executed hundreds of members of Iraq's Yazidis, has released a video that seeks to show it enlightened hundreds of members of the religious minority by converting them to Islam The production was issued not long after the group on Tuesday released a video showing the beheading of US journalist James Foley.The ISIS video, which the group called "Hundreds of Yazidis convert to Islam", gives no indication of the bloodshed that prompted tens of thousands of people to flee.In the video, two ISIS fighters - one a bearded middle-aged man dressed in black with an AK-47 assault rifle and another in a grey military uniform and camouflage capâ€” field questions in Arabic from what appears to be an ISIS interviewer. "Men, women and children have converted and I was with them and they are happy with their conversions," one of them says , adding: "We advice the Yazidis to come down from the mountain and convert.""If they stay on the mountain, they will die of starvation and thirst. This talk about aid from Western and crusader countries is all lies. If they convert, we will give them everything they need."The video then shows dozens of Yazidis getting off a bus, walking past a truck with an anti-aircraft weapon and hugging the militants. Seconds later, many are sitting on the floor of what looks like a school. Mostly young men prepare for the conversion ritual. "Right now you are infidels. After this you will become Muslims, you will have rights," a militant says. reuters
