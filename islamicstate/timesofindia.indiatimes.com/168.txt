NEW YORK: With 40 of its nationals still in captivity in Iraq, India may not join the all â€” out efforts of the US in creating a global coalition against the Islamic State terror group for which President Barack Obama is expected to seek the support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi So far, more than 40 countries have joined the US-led international coalition against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or the Islamic State (IS) as it is better known across the globe.According to the sources, India, which has been a victim of terrorism and has a very tough stance on the issue, will not be able to overtly go against Islamic State terror group that has gained control over large swaths of Syria and Iraq, where it still has its nationals as hostages."Our position is very well known against menace of terrorism. But we have 40 of our nationals who are still in captivity," the sources said.While India could secure release of its 46 nurses from the captivity of militants, its another 40 nationals, working on projects near the Iraqi city of Mosul were kidnapped by ISIS militants in early June.Obama, as he has been doing with other global leaders, is expected to urge Modi during their talks in Washington to join the international coalition against the IS terrorist outfit, which if left unchallenged poses a major threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.The White House, however, has refused to make any comment on the substance of discussion between Obama and Modi on September 29 and 30."As we've said, we believe there is a role for all countries to play. Beyond that, I'm not in position to preview the substance of the visit yet," Caitlin Hayden, spokesperson of the National Security Council of the White House, had said.ISIL militants have executed two American journalists and a British aid worker in Syria, prompting the West to join hands to combat the terror group.
