JEDDAH (Saudi Arabia): The United States pressed Arab nations on Thursday to join President Barack Obama's expanded campaign against jihadists in Iraq and Syria, but Damascus warned it would consider any action on its territory as an attack.As Iraq's new unity government and the Syrian opposition welcomed Obama's plan, the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his most powerful ally Russia strongly condemned the move."Any action of any kind without the consent of the Syrian government would be an attack on Syria," national reconciliation minister Ali Haidar said.In the Saudi port city of Jeddah, US secretary of state John Kerry was meeting his counterparts from 10 Arab countries and Turkey to press them to join a broad coalition against the Islamic State (IS) jihadists.Obama said late Wednesday he had ordered the US military to expand its operations against IS, a radical Islamist group that has seized a swathe of Iraq and Syria and committed horrifying atrocities."Our objective is clear: we will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIS through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy," Obama said in a television address, using an alternative acronym for the group."I will not hesitate to take action against ISIS in Syria, as well as Iraq."Oman's foreign minister Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah (left) and US secretary of state John Kerry talk before a meeting of the Gulf Arab region at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on September 11, 2014.
