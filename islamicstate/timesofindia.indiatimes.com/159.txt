LONDON: The Islamic State (ISIS) terror group plans to seize Iran's nuclear secrets, unleash a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing and Nazi-style eugenics to consolidate and expand its self-declared caliphate, according to a seized policy manifesto of the dreaded outfit.The group urged its members to plan for war with Iran and has ambitions to seize Tehran's nuclear secrets in a manifesto believed to have been written by Abdullah Ahmed al-Meshedani, a member of the group's highly secretive six-man war cabinet.The document, typed on perforated sheets, was seized by Iraqi special forces during a raid in March on the home of one of the commanders of ISIS, The Sunday Times reported today.In the document, which has been examined by western security officials — who believe it to be authentic — Meshedani wrote that ISIS aims to get hold of nuclear weapons with the help of Russia, to whom it would offer access to gas fields it controls in Iraq's Anbar province.Also, the documents said, Kremlin will have to give up "Iran and its nuclear programme and hands over its secrets." Russia would also have to abandon support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and back the Gulf States against Iran.Believed to be a policy manifesto prepared for senior members of ISIS, the document offers a unique insight into the ambitions of the Islamist commanders who have shocked the world with their fanaticism and brutality, the paper said.The ISIS militants have captured a swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has declared himself as Caliph of the Islamic State.The document contains 70 different plans like launching a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing, Nazi-style eugenics and intelligence gathering operations to consolidate and expand the group's self-declared Islamic caliphate, it said.Meshedani, whose duties include managing suicide bombers, also calls for stripping Shia Iran of "all its power" and destroying the Shia ascendancy in Iraq.He also incites followers to kill Iraqi military chiefs, Shia officials and Iranian-backed militias fighting for the Iraqi government, the paper said, citing the document.A security source familiar with the document told the paper: "Nothing shocks western governments these days in relation to ISIS and its fanatical aspirations."And we've known and feared for some time that they want to obtain chemical and nuclear weapons."In an indication of ISIS' brutal ideology, Meshedani writes that its intelligence operatives will "eliminate" its own leaders if they deviate from its "desired goal"."The leadership of the political wing must know that it is being watched and listened to by the intelligence apparatuses which pass on everything," he warns them.Meshedani also suggests buying islands from Yemen and the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, "to establish a military base on the flank of the Arab lands".
