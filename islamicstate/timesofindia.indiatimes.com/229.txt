SYDNEY: The Obama administration has begun directly providing weapons to Kurdish forces who have started to make gains against Islamic militants in northern Iraq, senior US officials said on Monday.Previously, the US had insisted on only selling arms to the Iraqi government in Baghdad, but the Kurdish peshmerga fighters had been losing ground to Islamic State militants in recent weeks.The officials wouldn't say which US agency is providing the arms or what weapons are being sent, but one official said it isn't the Pentagon. The CIA has historically done similar quiet arming operations.The move to directly aid the Kurds underscores the level of US concern about the Islamic State militants' gains in the north, and reflects the persistent administration view that the Iraqis must take the necessary steps to solve their own security problems.To bolster that effort, the administration is also very close to approving plans for the Pentagon to arm the Kurds, a senior official said. In recent days, the US military has been helping facilitate weapons deliveries from the Iraqis to the Kurds, providing logistic assistance and transportation to the north.The additional assistance comes as Kurdish forces yesterday took back two towns from the Islamic insurgents, aided in part by US airstrikes in the region.President Barack Obama authorized the airstrikes to protect US interests and personnel in the region, including at facilities in Irbil, as well as Yazidi refugees fleeing militants.At the same time, the administration is watching carefully as a political crisis brews in Baghdad.US Secretary of State John Kerry urged the people of Iraq to remain calm amid the political and military upheaval.Speaking in Australia today, Kerry said there should be no use of force by political factions as Iraq struggles form a government.He said the people of Iraq have made clear their desire for change and that the country's new president is acting appropriately despite claims of malfeasance by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.Maliki is resisting calls to step down and says he'll file a complaint against the president for not naming him prime minister.Kerry noted that Maliki's Shia bloc has put forward three other candidates for the prime minister job and says the US stands with the new president, Fouad Massoum.Maliki has accused Massoum of violating the constitution because he has not yet named a prime minister from the country's largest parliamentary faction, missing Sunday's deadline.
