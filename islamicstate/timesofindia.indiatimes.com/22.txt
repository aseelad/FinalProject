MURSITPINAR (Turkey): The Islamic State group was taking heavy losses in the Syrian battleground of Kobane on Sunday as Iraqi forces fought the jihadists buoyed by US backing for top government security appointments.US secretary of state John Kerry said the appointment of defence and interior ministers after weeks of delay was a "very positive step forward" in the fightback against IS in Iraq, which Washington has made its priority.US-led warplanes kept up their strikes on the jihadists around Kobane on Syria's northern border with Turkey, helping the town's Kurdish defenders to repulse a new attempt to cut their supply lines.The Kurdish fighters, who have been under IS assault for more than a month, weathered fierce street fighting and at least two jihadist suicide bombings but the front line remained unchanged on Sunday, a Kurdish official said."(IS) brought in reinforcements... and attacked hard," Idris Nassen told AFP by telephone."But thanks to air strikes and (the Kurdish fighters') response, they did not make any progress."A Youtube channel which posts videos from areas under the Islamic State (IS) group's control, allegedly shows the southern entrance of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border.

(AFP)Medics and witnesses reported a steady flow of bodies from the Kobane fighting arriving at an IS-controlled hospital further east, the Observatory said.The bodies of at least 70 IS fighters had been brought into the mortuary in the town of Tal Abyad over the past four days, they said.The US military has said it sees "encouraging" signs in the battle for Kobane, although it warns the town may still fall.But commanders have said repeatedly that the main priority remains the battle against IS in neighbouring Iraq, where the jihadists swept through much of the Sunni Arab heartland north and west of Baghdad in June.The minority community's grievances against the Shia led-government were a major factor in the lightning advance and Washington has been piling pressure on Baghdad to form an inclusive government capable of mounting a fightback.
