KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has strongly condemned the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying the group's actions are against the teachings of the Prophet and run counter to the Islamic law."The actions of the Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria and Iraq run counter to our faith, our culture, and our common humanity," Prime Minister Najib said.ISIS is an al-Qaida splinter group and it has seized hundreds of square miles in Iraq and Syria.Al-Qaida has distanced itself from the group, chiding it for its lack of teamwork in its aggressive, brutal expansion.Najib said Muslims around the world had reacted in horror to reports of mass executions, killings of civilians and evidence of brutality."They (ISIS) are against the teachings of the Prophet, a man of peace and moderation; and against Islamic law, which prizes the protection of life above all. We deplore those responsible and call on the international community to act in concert to prevent further violence," said the prime minister of the Muslim majority country.His remarks came amidst reports of three Malaysian women joining the ISIS forces as "comfort women"."These women are believed to have offered themselves in sexual comfort roles to ISIS fighters," The Malaysian Insider news portal reported, citing an unnamed intelligence official.The official said one of the women had travelled to the Middle East in December last year. Another woman in her 40s is believed to have linked up with ISIS forces sometime in April.The official said Malaysian women were not the only ones who were performing sexual jihad."Intelligence exchanged with other countries revealed that Sunni Muslim women from Australia and the United Kingdom had also joined up with ISIS," the official said.The intelligence official said British counterparts had revealed that more than 600 British Muslims are believed to be fighting for the ISIS.
