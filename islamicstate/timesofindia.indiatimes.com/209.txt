MOSUL, Iraq: Air strikes on three bases of the Islamic State group around their northern Iraqi hub of Mosul killed at least 25 jihadists overnight, medical sources and witnesses said on Monday.Residents said that warplanes struck IS targets in Zummar, a town about 70 kilometres (45 miles) northwest of Mosul, near Badush, a former prison west of Mosul and near a village called Aski Mosul.Medical sources said the bodies of 25 fighters were brought to the morgue in Mosul, which the jihadist organization has used as its main centre early June.It was not immediately clear whether the warplanes were Iraqi or from the US-led international coalition, which carries out daily raids against IS targets in Iraq and Syria.Zummar was one of the objectives of a ground operation launched by Kurdish troops a week ago.
