LONDON: British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday said the west is facing a "generational struggle" against a poisonous and extremist ideology of Islamic State which he said is a direct threat to the country."I believe we will be fighting this generational struggle for the rest of my political lifetime," Cameron said."We face in ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, now known as Islamic State) a new threat that is single-minded, determined and unflinching in pursuit of its objectives," Cameron wrote in Sunday Telegraph."We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a poisonous and extremist ideology," Cameron said, adding that Islamic State fighters sweeping across Syria and Iraq are a direct threat to the UK. Already it controls not just thousands of minds, but thousands of square miles of territory, sweeping aside much of the boundary between Iraq and Syria to carve out its so-called caliphate," he said.Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron visits a UK Aid disaster response centre where humanitarian supplies are being collected to be airlifted to Iraq at Cotswold airport in southern England, on August 14, 2014.
