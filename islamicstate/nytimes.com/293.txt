AROUND THE WORLD - Turkish Politician Charged With Bid for ...ANKARA, Turkey, Feb. 24â€” A state prosecutor today requested a prison term of 14 to 36 years for Necmettin Erbakan, an Islamic fundamentalist charged with trying to set up an Islamic state.

The prosecutor demanded 2-to-17-year terms for 33 of Mr. Erbakan's followers, including 17 members of Parliament from his National Salvation Party.

It was the first serious charge brought against a political leader since the military seized power and banned political activity in September. Up to now, only accusations like election law violations have been leveled against politicians.

Kemal Ataturk founded the modern Turkish republic on secularism and banished Islamic law. Though 99 percent of the 45 million people are Moslems, it is a crime to mix religion and politics. Chinese Set Guidelines For Reducing Population Special to the New York Times

PEKING, Feb. 24 - Chinese demographers announced target figures today for reducing the population that would give China an ''optimum population range'' of 650 to 700 million people by late in the next century. They are based on one child per family for the next 20 or 30 years.

The targets were disclosed at the third national symposium on population science that is meeting here. Demographers, cyberneticists and economists told the symposium that the targets took into account China's area, rate of economic development, unrenewable resources, proposed dietary standards, and environmental concerns, according to the New China News Agency.

If each couple has only one child, the population could stabilize at 700 million by the year 2080, the scientists said.
