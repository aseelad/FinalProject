Indiana: Rites Set for American Killed by Islamic State - NYTimes.comA funeral service for a former Army Ranger who was beheaded last weekend by Islamic State extremists will be held Friday at an Islamic center in Fishers, Ind. The center, the Al Huda Foundation, said in a statement that it was “honored to host this service” in memory of Peter Kassig, an aid worker who disappeared in Syria while delivering medical supplies. Mr. Kassig, the third American killed by the Islamic State, adopted the Muslim name Abdul-Rahman after spending more than a year in captivity. Over the summer, Mr. Kassig was able to smuggle a letter to his family in which he detailed fears for his life. “Just know I’m with you. Every stream, every lake, every field and river,” Mr. Kassig wrote. “In the woods and in the hills, in all the places you showed me. I love you.”
