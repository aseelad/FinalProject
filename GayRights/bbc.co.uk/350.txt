Gay rights campaigners have praised the opening ceremony moment when John Barrowman kissed a male cast member at a mock Gretna Green.

Director of Stonewall Colin MacFarlane said it was a "bold, confident statement" to other countries in the Commonwealth where being gay is still illegal.

Hugh Torrance, from Pride House Scotland, added that the moment was a "great thing for Scotland".
