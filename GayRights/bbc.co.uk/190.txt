Gay rights activists in New York have dumped vodka onto the street as part of a growing global protest over new laws in Russia that target homosexuals.

A growing number of gay bar owners across the United States have also vowed to stop serving Russian vodka.

Protesters are angry about a controversial law signed by President Vladimir Putin banning the promotion of "non-traditional values" to children, the refusal to allow gay pride events and harassment of gay activists.
