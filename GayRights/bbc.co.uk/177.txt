British Prime Minister David Cameron has appeared on a special edition of the BBC's World Have Your Say programme, answering questions ahead of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland next week.

The prime minister took time to answer some questions from Africa.

Gertrude Chelimo from Nairobi, Kenya, accused the G8 group of rich nations of failing to fulfil a promise to double aid to Africa, and asked Mr Cameron whether aid to the continent is still relevant.

A young Nigerian man who lives in London, Bisi, asked for his reaction to a bill approved by Nigerian lawmakers last month banning same-sex marriage - setting jail terms of up to 14 years for offenders - and making it illegal to form gay groups or organisations.
