The actor Simon Callow has questioned the calls for a boycott of - or moving - the Winter Olympics from the Russian city of Sochi next year, as he claimed: "boycotts are rarely effective, talking is."

The actor, who said he knew what it felt like to be a "second class citizen" due to previous gay laws in the UK, compared Putin's anti-gay laws with Section 28 legislation in England, Wales and Scotland. They were introduced in 1988 and repealed in 2003.

Mr Callow appeared on Wednesday's Daily Politics where he debated this personal film with two MPs
