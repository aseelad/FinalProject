A Coca-Cola website allowing users to name coke cans has been replaced by the company following social media controversy and a #BBCtrending investigation.

The site allowed people to write their names on coke cans but wouldn't allow the word "gay" to be used.

It caused a storm on social media, but why was the site - based in South Africa - attracting the attention of the global gay rights movement? Coca-Cola sponsor the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, and many Olympic sponsors are being criticised by gay rights activists who oppose a Russian law that imposes fines for providing "propaganda" about homosexuality to minors. Coca-Cola have now taken down the site and apologised for any offence caused, saying they are "a strong supporter of the LGBT community".
