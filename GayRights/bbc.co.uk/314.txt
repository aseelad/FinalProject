Hundreds of people took part in a demonstration to mark the International Day Against Homophobia in the Cuban city of Cienfuegos.

The rally against homophobia was led by President Raul Castro's daughter, Mariela.

In the 1960's, homosexuals would be sent to counter-revolutionary camps by the Communist authorities of the island.
