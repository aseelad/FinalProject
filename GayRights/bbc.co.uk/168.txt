Gay rights groups have poured bottles of Coca Cola down the drain in a protest at Times Square in New York.

They are angry at the company's sponsorship of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Russia.

Demonstrators claim that the soft drinks giant "supports hate" by staying silent towards Russia's controversial new law on gay propaganda.

Russian officials say competing gay athletes will not face discrimination.
