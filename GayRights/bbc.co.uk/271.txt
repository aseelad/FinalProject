The government has announced dates for the next step towards legalising same sex marriage in England and Wales.

The bill's remaining stages will be debated on 20 and 21 May, Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley told MPs.

When the bill was last on the floor of the House, it was approved by a 225-vote majority, despite opposition from almost half of Conservative MPs.

A group of MPs has been taking detailed evidence on the proposals in a public committee since February.

If the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is approved on 21 May, it will pass to the Lords for further scrutiny.

During the remaining stages - report stage and third reading - MPs consider amendments made at committee stage and get a final opportunity to review the contents of a bill.
