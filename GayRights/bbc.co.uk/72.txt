Although homosexuality was decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967, this did not happen in Scotland until 1980. In Northern Ireland, the law was changed in 1982, while this took a further decade on the Isle of Man. The age of consent for male homosexuals in Scotland was lowered to 18 in 1995. This came a year after it was reduced to 18 in England and Wales as a compromise over a failed attempt to set a uniform age of consent at 16 (the existing age for heterosexuals). Although further efforts to create an equal age of consent were overruled by the House of Lords, this was eventually achieved across the UK in 2000.
