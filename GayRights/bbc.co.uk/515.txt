The Scottish Executive said it was looking "with interest" at the move south of the border to give same sex couples next-of-kin rights.

The equality minister in England and Wales, Jacqui Smith, said she wants to give gay partners the same rights as heterosexual partners.

In Scotland, the plans have been welcomed by the Lesbian and Gay Equality Network.

The network's Tim Hopkins said: "One of the most important things here is for the Scottish Executive to consult in Scotland on similar proposals."

The Westminster plans will allow partnerships to be formally registered, giving visiting rights in hospital, a share in a dead partner's pension and exemption from inheritance tax on a shared home.

The Roman Catholic Church is against the idea of civil partnerships, warning they would undermine marriage.

But the Moderator of the Church of Scotland, Professor Iain Torrance, said if they encourage faithfulness in relationships, he would have no objection.

Green MSP Patrick Harvie introduced a proposal for similar legislation for Scotland in May.

The proposal aims to grant unmarried couples in committed relationships equality in areas such as pensions, inheritance, and bereavement.

Mr Harvie said: "I urge the UK government to ensure that parliamentary time is made available for this important reform which will affect tens of thousands of families.

"Most importantly, we urge the Scottish Executive to issue its own consultation on civil partnerships, as we would like to see a system in Scotland which is open to mixed-sex couples as well as same-sex couples."

The executive said it is looking with interest at the idea of civil partnerships and will consider them as part of its family law reforms due some time in the next four years.
