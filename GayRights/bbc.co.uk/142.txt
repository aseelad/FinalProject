Guernsey is "woefully behind" in the introduction of civil partnerships, says Deputy Elis Bebb.

Gay couples can get married in England and Wales from March, yet the States is moving at a "glacial pace" towards it, he said.

The government is trying to "play catch-up" on all social legislation.

Couple Mark and Martin Gavet said: "Legislation defines the boundaries of a society and Guernsey has made gay people second class citizens."

The Gavets were joined in a civil partnership in Wales in 2011, and believe that marriage is a "symbol of their commitment to each other."

The couple said Guernsey needed to change its policy on equality.

Islander Martin Bishop said: "The states should just vote this matter through as soon as possible."

Deputy Le Tocq previously stated that, as a Christian, his personal view was that marriage should be between a man and a woman, although he thought the States should not enforce that view.

Deputy Bebb said: "Marriage is more than joining a couple, it gives a couple rights and affords protection to partners."
