A Channel Islands equal rights group has been speaking to local church leaders on same sex marriage.

Liberate said it had received a "positive response so far" from faith groups in Jersey, where only civil partnerships are recognised.

The move comes after the States decided to delay changing the law on same sex marriage in July.

Campaigners want the island to adopt the same laws which the UK adopted in March, allowing same sex weddings.

Liberate also met Jersey's Chief Minister Ian Gorst, as part of his review into legalising gay marriage.

He is conducting a "detailed study", which is due to be completed by 31 December.
