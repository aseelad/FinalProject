Gay rights campaigners from the north west visited Stormont on Tuesday to protest against recent comments made by Iris Robinson.

The DUP MP and MLA described homosexuality as an "abomination" and urged gay people to seek counselling.

David McCartney from the Rainbow Project in Derry said he hoped members of the DUP would attend.

"It is exceptionally important that the gay community in this country feel they have a stake in Stormont," he said.

Sinn FÃ©in MLA Martina Anderson said that Stormont must be a welcoming place to everyone "regardless of sexual orientation".

"Of course, everyone is entitled to their religious beliefs and to freedom of speech.

"But with those rights come responsibilities and elected representatives in particular need to be conscious of the power of their words."
