Culture Secretary Maria Miller has announced that the Church of England and the Church in Wales will be excluded from the government's planned new law to allow gay couples to marry.

Other churches would be allowed to "opt in" and perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.

In a statement to MPs, she said the government wanted to strike a balance between the rights of gay couples and the rights of religious organisations.
