Australia's highest court has overturned a law allowing gay marriage in the Australian Capital Territory.

The national government successfully argued that the law created confusion, since in federal legislation marriage was defined as between a man and a woman.

Some 27 gay couples married in Canberra at the weekend but those marriages will now be annulled.
