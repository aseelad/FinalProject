Cuban gay rights campaigner Mariela Castro has led a protest march against homophobia in the capital Havana.

Ms Castro is the head of Cuba's National Sexual Education Centre - and daughter of President Raul Castro.

Before Raul Castro came to power in 2008, no gay rights marches had been allowed in Cuba.
