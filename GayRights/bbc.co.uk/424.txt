Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in the French capital Paris in support of government plans to legalise marriage and adoption for same-sex couples.

The rally comes two weeks after a protest by 340,000 people opposed to the draft law.

The bill is due be debated in parliament on Tuesday.
