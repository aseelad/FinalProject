BBC Sports News correspondent David Bond reports on how Russia's controversial laws on homosexuality are affecting the Winter Olympics.

Australia's Belle Brockhoff, who will compete in snowboard cross at the Winter Olympics, is targeting a gold medal at the Games as she believes most people "won't care" about her opinion unless she wins.

A series of worldwide protests against discrimination in Russia were held as the Sochi Games opened, with activists who oppose Russia's new legislation banning gay 'propaganda' towards children believing it adds to widespread persecution of the LGBT communities.
