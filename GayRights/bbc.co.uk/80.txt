A parade highlighting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights is being staged in Cardiff for the second time as part of the annual Mardi Gras festival.

Members of the LGBT community say the fact the main event takes place in the Millennium Stadium shows wider acceptance with the ground seen as the home of Welsh rugby.

Rugby referee Nigel Owens, one of the first Welsh sporting figures to come out as gay, is one of those involved in the event.
