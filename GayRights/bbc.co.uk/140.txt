A masked, bare-chested protester waving a lit flare ran onto the court at the men's final of the French Open tennis in Paris but was restrained by security before he could interrupt the match.

A few minutes earlier, two bare-chested men stood up in the front rows, holding a banner accusing France of trampling on children's rights.

Other protesters called on President Francois Hollande to resign.

The protesters were angered by France's decision to legalise gay marriage.

The first same-sex wedding in France took place last month under tight security.

Campaigners against gay marriage and adoption by same-sex couples, backed by the Catholic Church and conservative opposition, argue the law undermines an essential building block of society.

The protests at the French Open final were quickly snuffed out.

When the protester climbed on the court from one of the front rows with the words "Kids right" written on his stomach, he was quickly bundled to the ground by security officials and taken away.

Spain's Rafael Nadal, who was about to serve for the second set at the time, was standing nearby.

Nadal went on to win the final in straight sets, defeating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.

Tournament director Gibert Ysern condemned the protests as "pathetic", saying he did not want to give them added publicity.
