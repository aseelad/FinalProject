In the late 1930s, a tiny string of rocky islands in the Adriatic played a part in the effort by Benito Mussolini's Fascists to suppress homosexuality.

Around 45 men believed to be homosexuals in the Sicilian city of Catania were rounded up and consigned to internal exile.

They eventually found themselves on the island of San Domino, in the Tremitis.

This whole episode has been largely forgotten - but recently gay, lesbian and transgender rights activists have come to the archipelago to hold a small ceremony remembering the episode.

Italian MP Ivan Scalfarotto talked to BBC News about the state of gay rights in his country today.
