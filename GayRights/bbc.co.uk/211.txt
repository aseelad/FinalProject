A Christian-run bakery that refused a customer's request to make a cake with a slogan supporting gay marriage could face a discrimination case in court.

Ashers Baking Company declined an order from a gay rights activist, asking for cake featuring the Sesame Street puppets, Bert and Ernie.

The firm's general manager, Daniel McArthur, said the experience was unsettling but was convinced they made the right decision and that Christians should be allowed to follow their beliefs in the day-to-day running of their business.

He was speaking in a recorded statement published by the Christian Institute.
