The right-wing opposition won a vote to declare the draft legislation inadmissible because there were not enough government supporters present.

The legislation can be put to parliament again but not in the immediate future.

The new law was intended to establish a formal contract of union for homosexual couples giving them the right to a number of financial advantages, such as tax relief on inheritance.

Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the legislation was intended to reflect "the evolution" of modern French society, but his opponents argued it undermined the institution of marriage.

The legislation did not include proposals to allow same-sex couples to adopt children.

However, the plans were bitterly opposed by right-wing politicians and religious leaders of all faiths.

In a joint statement, Catholic bishops described the bill as "useless and dangerous" and predicted it would undermine "fundamental structures of society".

Reacting to criticism of the legislation, Mr Jospin said: "Opponents are creating problems where there are none. Marriage is an institution and will remain so."

"Adoption (by homosexuals) is forbidden and will remain so."

The legislation reached the National Assembly, which Mr Jospin's socialist party controls, after a decade of lobbying by gay rights groups.
