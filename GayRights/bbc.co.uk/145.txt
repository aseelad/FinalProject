Gay rights activists across the world are holding a day of protests against the Russian government, just two days before the Winter Olympics begin in the southern resort of Sochi.

The protests seek to persuade sponsors of the event to speak out over Russia's controversial laws on homosexuality.

The gay rights protests are being held in 19 cities around the globe, including Jerusalem, where protesters chanted: "No excuses, homophobia is terror."
