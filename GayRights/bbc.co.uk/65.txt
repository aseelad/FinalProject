Gay rights campaigners in Uganda must consider leaving the country to ensure their own personal security following the the passing of a bill to toughen the punishment for homosexual acts, a leading spokesperson says.

Claire Byarugaba, of the Civil Society Coalition on Human Rights and Constitutional Law, told the BBC that although her organisation would rather remain in the country and fight, she believes she could face a "witch-hunt".

She hopes to "re-strategise" the future of their work from outside Uganda.
