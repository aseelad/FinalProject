In 1992, the year this programme was broadcast, UK laws treated consensual sex between gay men under 21 as a criminal offence. In this frank and open programme, John Nicolson investigates accusations of inequality in the law by homosexuals. He speaks to Michael Cashman, actor and campaigner for pressure group Stonewall, and hears from gay men who claim they have been the victims of police entrapment. He also accompanies MP Edwina Currie on a trip to the Netherlands to experience life in a country that has had a uniform age of consent since the 1970s. However, with conflicting results from opinion polls, is there enough public pressure for homosexuals to be treated equally under the law?
