More than 100,000 people are taking part in a march through the streets of Rome in celebration of gay rights.

The Vatican, which condemns homosexuality as evil, tried but failed to get the celebrations postponed or transferred to another city.

The climax of World Pride week is the march which passes near the Colliseum and ends at the Circus Maximus where chariot races were held in ancient times.

Prominent Italians, including politicians and film stars earlier said they would join in the international gay rights march as they regard sexual freedom as a basic human right.

For the past week there has been much earnest talk at World Pride seminars about the social and religious discrimination faced by gays in many countries.

Frank de Barnardo works with a group of American Catholic priests, nuns and lay people who have recently been muzzled by the Vatican for ministering to homosexual men and women.

"I think the Vatican missed a wonderful opportunity to dialogue with gay and lesbian people," he said. "I think they missed a wonderful opportunity to show the true meaning of the jubilee whose theme is open wide the doors to Christ."

A group of Italian neo-fascists has organised a counter demonstration in another part of Rome.
