More than 50,000 homosexuals are thought to have been convicted under the Nazis "because of their sexual orientation," with thousands of them sent to concentration camps and murdered.

Current research suggests 54,000 men and women were convicted of homosexual acts and about 7,000 killed in the camps.

The monument, designed by Danish-Norwegian artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset, contains a window that invites the visitor to look inside and see a film of a homosexual couple kissing. The image is to be alternate between two men and two women every two years.
