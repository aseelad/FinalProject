Coming out in Russia may now even become more difficult than before, following the adoption of a law in June that prohibits what is called 'propaganda' of non-traditional sexual orientation among minors. As a result, just talking about homosexuality has become risky.

Observers say that the law has emboldened anti-gay protesters to use violence against those from the LGBT community. As a result, many Russians are hoping to leave their country. One homosexual man has already been granted asylum in Germany due to his sexuality.

Kristina and Mikhail are deciding to stay put, however - for now, at least.
