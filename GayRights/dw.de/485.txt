This panel discussion will highlight the conflict-ridden area of sexual self-determination in realizing the human right to education. Whereas numerous organizations and institutions have developed innovative approaches to integrating the perspectives of LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans- and intersexual people) into education over the past several decades, there are still a great number of states and stakeholders strongly opposed to the idea of empowering children and youth for sexual self-determination. Panelists and participants will share their ideas, highlight conflict areas and discuss possible solutions.
