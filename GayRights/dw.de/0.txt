The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people vary worldwide. LGBT rights are human and civil rights and laws cover everything from same-sex marriage to persecution for same-sex relationships.

The UN Human Rights Commission has documented violations of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, including hate crime, discrimination and criminalization of homosexuality in various countries throughout the world. Anti-LGBT laws are institutionalized in many countries and include sodomy laws penalizing consensual same-sex sexual activity with fines, jail terms or the death penalty. In other countries where LGBT people do not face persecution, their civil rights are limited. Examples of this include laws preventing same-sex marriage, LGBT adoption, immigration equality and anti-discrimination for employment and housing. In 2011 the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights and urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights.
