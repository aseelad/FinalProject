Despite international pressure, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law a controversial bill that could see gay people jailed for life. The bill was passed by parliament in December after a clause was dropped that called for the death penalty. The law now says that homosexuals convicted of repeated offenses should be jailed for life.
