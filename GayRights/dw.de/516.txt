"This is the breakthrough DRM has been waiting for" says Peter Senger, Deutsche Welle's technical director and chair of the DRM Consortium.

He was referring to the new RS500 module manufactured by the UK-based company RadioScape, which can receive DRM as well as DAB, FM with RDS, LW, MW, and SW. The company says receivers based on this module could have end user prices below $250 dollars, almost a quarter of the current market price.

Update Europe, a three hour music-and-chat lunchtime programme, was launched by Deutsche Welle on November 1st 2004 for a pan-European audience and specially conceived for the new DRM digital shortwave technology.
