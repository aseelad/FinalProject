Friday marks the 10th anniversary of the first gay marriage in Europe. On April 1, 2001, four same-sex couples were married in the Netherlands, the same day the Netherlands' same-sex marriage law came into effect.

In addition to the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium, Spain, Sweden and Norway have legalized gay marriage in Europe.

In Germany, gay marriage is not recognized, but "registered partnerships" are allowed. These partnerships provide some, but not all, of the rights of marriage.
