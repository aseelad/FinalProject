A central England court on Friday convicted Ihjaz Ali, Kabir Ahmed and Razwan Javed for stirring up hatred against homosexuals by distributing leaflets detailing ways to kill them.

In an unprecedented ruling on the grounds of new anti-discrimination legislation, Ali was jailed for two years, while Ahmed and Javed were sentenced to 15 months each.

The legislation, which was introduced in 2010, makes it a crime to incite hatred based on sexual orientation.

At Derby Crown Court, all three were found guilty of handing out pamphlets in July 2010, calling for homosexuals to face the death penalty. They handed them out close to the Jamia Mosque in Derby, 130 miles (210 kilometers) north of London.

They gave out a pamphlet entitled "The Death Penalty?", which quoted Islamic texts that said capital punishment was the only way to free society from homosexuality. The pamphlet read: "The death sentence is the only way this immoral crime can be erased from corrupting society and act as a deterrent for any other ill person who is remotely inclined in this bent way.

'Bent' can be used in the UK as a derogatory term for homosexuality.

The leaflets went on to offer burning, being thrown from a high point such as a mountain or building, or being stoned to death as suitable methods.

"It follows that your intention was to do great harm in a peaceful community," Judge John Burgess said.

Two other leaflets, called "Turn or Burn" and "GAY (God Abhors You)", were also distributed.

"I am obviously keen to dissuade anyone from distributing this sort of material in the future," Burgess said, sentencing the men.

Two other men were found not guilty on the same charges.
