Gay rights organization in South Africa say that many black lesbians live in fear of sexual assault or worse - two of the players of the Chosen Few team became victims too. Laura Schweiger investigates how, in a country whose constitution guarantees equal rights for all, its lesbian community is struggling to stay safe.
