In 1999, Macedonia was confronted with hundreds of thousands of refugees who had fled Kosovo. Many of them were Roma and stayed in the capital city of Skopje. We take a look at one of Skopje’s 10 municipalities - and one that is home to many Roma. Šuto Orizari is home to over 22,000 people and also has the largest Roma settlement in the world. Living conditions are poor and most are unemployed. Ljatife Sikovska is Roma herself and wants to help improve the situation for her community. She does this with her organization "Ambrela", which offers programs on education, human rights and gender equality.
