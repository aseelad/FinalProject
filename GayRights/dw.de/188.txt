Under very heavy security, Belgrade was set to host its first gay pride parade in four years on Sunday after a hiatus due to concerns over homophobic attacks. Police in riot gear blocked central Belgrade with barricades and armored vehicles, and officials said mounted units were on standby in case riots broke out.

The parade was due to pass through the center of the city at noon (1000 GMT). It's only the second such event to receive the protection of Serbian authorities in a staunchly traditionalist society that has seen repeated acts of homophobic violence.

At the previous parade in 2010, a few hundred gay activists and supporters marched briefly while police battled some 6,000 trouble makers trying to penetrate the cordons. Dozens of people were injured on both sides and nearly 200 were arrested. After that, authorities banned the parade citing security concerns.

"I feel phenomenal. Our efforts of the past three years have borne fruit," said co-organizer Boban Stojanovic. Asked about the scale of the police operation, another co-organizer Goran Miletic said: "This is the Serbian version of the right to free assembly and speech."

In anticipation of the march, a few thousand protesters marched against the parade on Saturday. Earlier this week, the Serbian Orthodox Church compared homosexuality to pedophilia.

In mid-September, international human rights group Amnesty International condemned the brutal attack of a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activist in Belgrade, saying it was motivated by xenophobic hatred.
