Hundreds of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transvestites paraded through the streets of Kathmanduâ€˜s old city on August 11. Gaijatra, meaning festival of the cow in Nepali, is a Hindu festival commemorating those who have died during the year. Traditionally, it was the only day people felt free to cross dress. For the last five years, it has provided an occasion for a celebration of LGBT identity.
