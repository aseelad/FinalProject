In a divided ruling against Teresa Pires and Helena Paixao, the high court said in a statement that it had reviewed a successful appeal by the two women that reversed an earlier court ruling denying them the right to wed, and reinstated the lower court's verdict by three votes to two.

The Portuguese constitution forbids discrimination based on sexual orientation. The women had been trying since 2006 to overturn the decision using that article.

The two women were turned away by a Lisbon registry office because the law stipulates that marriage is between people of different sexes.

The Constitutional Court said in a statement on July 31 that the constitution does not state that same-sex marriages must be permitted.

On July 29, Prime Minister Jose Socrates and his Socialist Party presented its manifesto for the Sept. 27 general election. Allowing people of the same sex to wed in the predominantly Roman Catholic country was among the proposals.

The Portuguese chapter of the International Gay and Lesbian Association said in a statement: "The decision makes more evident the urgency of solving this issue via parliament by parties wanting to fight discrimination and promote basic equality,"
