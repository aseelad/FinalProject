More than a million people streamed through the streets of Madrid to protest against a loosening of Spain's abortion laws on Saturday, one of the largest demonstrations since anti-war rallies held in 2003 and 2004.

The Madrid regional government estimated the crowd at 1.2 million. A spokesman for one of the rally organizers, HazteOir (Make Yourself Heard), told Agence France Presse that 1.5 million people had attended.

"The presence of each of you here today in this demonstration is a commitment to fight for life," Benigno Blanco, head of a group called Forum on the Family," told the crowd. "Those of you who govern us must listen to the voice from the streets."

Marchers held signs reading "For Life, Women and Motherhood," "Women Against Abortion" and "Madrid 2009, Capital of Life."

Current Spanish abortion laws, introduced in 1985, prohibit abortion except in cases of rape, fetal malformation, or where the continuation of the pregnancy would cause physical or mental harm to the mother. The reform's supporters say that the status quo unfairly turns women and their doctors into criminals.





The proposed reform would allow abortion for any woman over the age of 16 up to the 14th week of pregnancy. Abortions would be available until the 22nd week if the mother's health was judged to be at risk or if the fetus was deformed. Abortions after the 22nd week would be limited to cases where the fetus had a serious or incurable medical condition.

A poll by Spanish digital newspaper ABC said 42 percent of Spaniards believed there was no overwhelming popular support for the reforms, with 38 percent saying that there was overwhelming support for them.

Parliament is expected to vote on the changes later this year.

Equality Minister Bibiana Aido, who pushed the reforms, said she had "total respect" for the protesters, but added that "nobody has a monopoly on morality."

"No woman can be penalized for taking such a difficult decision as that of abortion," she told AFP.
