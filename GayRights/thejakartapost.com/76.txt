House to propose extension of Komnas HAM's chairmanship | The ...The House of Representatives will propose the extension of the terms of office for the current National Commission on Human Rights’ (Komnas HAM) commissioners due to the limited span of time to select a new chairmanship.

House Deputy Speaker Priyo Budi Santosa of the Golkar Party said on Thursday that there was not much time available to appoint new Komnas HAM commissioners, who were scheduled to end their terms by the end of this month.

“I personally think that extensions are the best solution. The House will effectively begin sessions on August 27 after a month of recess. It will be impossible to immediately arrange fit and proper tests to select 30 candidates for Komnas HAM commissioners,” Priyo said.

“Therefore, we will propose to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to issue a presidential decree to allow such extensions,” Priyo told reporters at his office.

Priyo added that the extension period would allow Komnas HAM chairman Ifdhal Kasim and his colleagues to have more time to investigate the 1965 purge, the mysterious shootings between 1982 and 1985, and the Lapindo mudflow, which have all been categorized as human rights violations.

The House’s Commission III overseeing law and human rights will choose 15 out of 30 aspirants, including Indonesian gay rights activist Dede Oetomo, Komnas HAM’s commissioners Yosep Adi Prasetyo and Nur Kholis, and lawyer Taufik Basari. (lfr)
