Mozilla CEO resigns after furor over gay rights | The Jakarta PostMozilla co-founder Brendan Eich is stepping down as CEO after protests of his support of a gay marriage ban in California.

The Mountain View-based nonprofit maker of the Firefox browser had promoted him last week.

At issue was Eich's $1,000 donation in 2008 to the campaign to pass California's Proposition 8, a constitutional amendment that outlawed same-sex marriages. The ban was overturned when the U.S. Supreme Court last year left in place a lower-court ruling striking down the ballot measure.

Mozilla Chairwoman Mitchell Baker apologized for the company's actions in an open letter online Thursday. She says Eich is stepping down for the company's sake.

She says Mozilla believes in equality and freedom of speech. It is still discussing what is next for its leadership.
