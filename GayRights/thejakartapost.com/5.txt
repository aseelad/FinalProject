Surabaya Police ban gay rights group conference | The Jakarta PostThe Surabaya Police in East Java has decided not to issue a permit for a regional conference of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA), slated to be held from Wednesday to Friday.



Adj. Sr. Comr. Sri Setyo Rahayu told tempointeraktif.com that the provincial police refused to issue a permit for the event and the city police had followed suit.



Rahayu said there were also indications the conference could be “vulnerable” should it go ahead.

 

Earlier, the local branches of the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), the highest Muslim authority, and the Muhammadiyah, the country's second-largest Muslim organization, had objected to the conference.
