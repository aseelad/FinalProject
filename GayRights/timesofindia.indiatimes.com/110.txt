PANAJI: The number of gays entering into wedlock in Goa is on the rise and groups working for homosexual rights are demanding legal cover for such marriages.

"In the last couple of years in Goa, we got 25 such gay couples married. They don't have social acceptance but the number of gay marriages is rising," said Vishant Chodankar of the Humsafar trust in Goa.

The NGO is the only one working for gay rights in Goa.

"Fearing social stigma and discrimination, we had to conduct all these marriages in a clandestine manner," he said.

A few years ago, a renowned male fashion designer based in Goa solemnised his marriage to his male partner. It was recorded as the first gay marriage in India.

Chodankar, who is himself married to a male partner, feels loyalty in gay marriages is much more than in conventional marriages.

Without legality and social acceptance, many gay partners meet during the day and live with their parents.

"They are ready to come out in public with their relationship if there is social acceptance," Chodankar said.

He says the NGO is worried about high susceptibility to sexually-transmitted diseases among gays.

"Every year, we meet around 1,000 to 1,500 new gay couples in Goa itself. There will be many others. We have initiated an exercise to educate them about the high risk they face," Chodankar said.

Referring to the demand for legalising gay marriages, he said, "Gay couples cut across the age group of 18 to 50 years. We need the government's help to legalise such an institution," he added.
