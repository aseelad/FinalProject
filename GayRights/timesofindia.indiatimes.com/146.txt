This judgment comes as a rude shock to the nation that prides itself in being progressive. This is nothing short of an insult. The Supreme Court is losing its credibility by passing such verdicts. I have worked with many homosexuals for long and can understand what it means for the LGBT community. If Rituparno Ghosh was alive today, he would have been called a criminal! But I am sure of one thing, neither will it halt the gay rights movement nor will it stop people from leading their lives the way they want to. Nobody, including the Supreme Court, can have a say in the private life pf people, as long as the said person is not causing any inconvenience to others. It is the will of God if someone is born a certain way. And I think, God is the supreme Supreme Court.
