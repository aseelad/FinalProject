KATHMANDU: When Bollywood director Anirban Dhar toured Nepal this week to showcase his new film, "I Am", he had two keen desires: to visit the fabled Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu and find a gay bar in Thamel, the place tourists flock to in the capital. Bollywood's only openly gay film director also had a teasing request for Sunil Babu Pant, Nepal's only openly homosexual MP and founder of the gay rights movement in the conservative Himalayan republic."I wish Sunil would find me a partner," said Dhar aka Onir half-jokingly.Such jokes and even serious considerations began to pour in since 2008-end, after Nepal's Supreme Court struck a vigorous blow for gay rights, recognising same sex marriages and ordering the government to enact laws to allow them. It also ordered the government to protect the rights of the gay community, leading to such unprecedented government recognition as issuing "Third Gender" identity cards and giving gays a place on electoral rolls.But now, the new civil and criminal codes proposed by the government are threatening to undermine all that and bring homosexuality under the taboo of "unnatural sexual offences", just as the dreaded Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code had done in India. The new provisions to marriage regard the union as only that between a man and woman and sodomy still remains a punishable offence as "unnatural sex"."If these bills become law, they will undermine the growth of the gay rights movement in Nepal and criminalise gays," said Pant, whose Blue Diamond Society (BDS), Nepal's first gay rights organisation, has begun protesting against the bills. On Wednesday, when the UN Human Rights Council began its first Universal Periodic Review of Nepal's human rights situation, BDS representative Manisha, a transgender born Suben Dhakal, raised a dissenting voice."I am Manisha Dhakal from Nepal speaking on behalf of the Blue Diamond Society and the Sexual Rights Initiative," said Dhakal, in her new persona of a woman. "The proposed civil and criminal laws by the Ministry of Law, which have been tabled in the Nepali parliament, contain provisions to re-criminalize so-called 'unnatural sexual offenses' and to define marriage as only between a man and a woman. These attempts by the law ministry are a clear sign not to follow international human rights standards, a clear intention not to implement Supreme Court's decision and also go against the spirit of the interim and new draft constitution of Nepal."Nepal's gay community is now calling on the international community to make the Nepal government implement the Supreme court's decisions fully and ensure that the proposed civil and criminal laws are amended to ensure the human rights and equality of sexual and gender minorities.
