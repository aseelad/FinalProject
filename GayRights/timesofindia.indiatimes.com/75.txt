Have waited too long to say this. I'm an employee of @mozilla and I'm asking @brendaneich to step down as CEO. https://t.co/K3OqeImUnU â€” iamjessklein (@iamjessklein) March 27, 2014

NEW DELHI: Mozilla, the company behind the popular Firefox web browser, on Friday announced that their controversial CEO Brendan Eich is resigning.Eich has been under fire for his views on gay marriage and gay rights. He reportedly donated $1,000 to an anti-gay organization that lobbied for ban on same-sex marriages in California in 2008.When Eich became Mozilla CEO on March 24, a controversy started over his views on same-sex marriage. Many Mozilla employees took to Twitter to register their displeasure at Eich's views. A few days ago, Ok Cupid, a dating website, said that it would be asking its users to change their web browser if they were using Firefox because of Eich's position on same-sex marriage.The resignation comes a day after Eich said that he would not resign for his personal beliefs.In a blog post, executive chairwoman at Mozilla Mitchell Baker, wrote, "Brendan Eich has chosen to step down from his role as CEO. He's made this decision for Mozilla and our community ... Mozilla believes both in equality and freedom of speech. Equality is necessary for meaningful speech. And you need free speech to fight for equality. Figuring out how to stand for both at the same time can be hard."Baker also wrote, "We didn't move fast enough to engage with people once the controversy started. We're sorry. We must do better."Eich is a Mozilla co-founder and has been with the company for over 15 years. He is also the creator of JavaScript.
