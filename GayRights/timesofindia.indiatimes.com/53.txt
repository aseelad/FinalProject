MUMBAI: Humsafar Trust, a city-based organization of gay men, is working towards supporting the legal challenge to the Supreme Court order upholding Section 377â€”an archaic British law criminalizing homosexuality."I was saddened when Justice G S Singhvi, while delivering the Supreme Court order, alleged he had never seen a gay man. While the petitioners against Section 377 included human rights organizations, psychiatrists and parents of gay children, it did not include members of the gay community. We would like gay men to come forward in court and tell the judges of how Section 377 has affected their daily lives," said Ashok Row Kavi, founder of Humsafar.Kavi is curious to know how Justice Singhvi could claim he had never seen a gay man, despite the existence of pride marches across urban India. He asked, "Who did he feel the marches comprised? Ghosts?"He feels that if the gay community directly addressed the judiciary, the community would be able to put forth a view that homosexuals were very much a part of Indian society and not an alien species influenced by the West.Kavi is surprised that SC judges, who have often cited judgments from British and US courts, could call homosexuality an outside phenomenon. "This is an Indian issue, not an American one. I am an Indian and have lived my entire life in this country. I have never lived in America."The organization had hailed the Delhi high court verdict reading down Section 377, which made a clear distinction between public morality and constitutional morality. With the SC verdict, Kavi said that, for the first time, an entire community has been constitutionally excluded.
