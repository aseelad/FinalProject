SURAT: At least 250 lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and their supporters participated in the state's first LGBT rally that was taken out here on Sunday. Rally participants performed garba on traditional tracks played on a DJ sound system. The organizers planned the event around Navratri as it is the longest dancing festival to be held anywhere in the world."It is about the feminine thing inside all of us. We explored other festive seasons but then finalized to hold the rally during the Navratri festival," said Swagat Shah, who planned the event with the support of Forum Foundation, a community-based organization (CBO) from Vadodara.The Gujarat LGBT Pride Festival was organized from Athwalines to Kargil Chowk. The participants belonging to different NGOs and CBOs had come from Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. Majority of them had their faces covered."There were a few local participants and some supported the event from a distance while sitting in their vehicles. The event was held to express support to all LGBTs," Shah said.A Varachha resident, Paresh, participated in the event without covering his face. "People make fun of me because of my orientation. I felt honoured by taking part in the Gujarat LGBT Pride Festival. All LGBTs get encouragement from such events," said Paresh, a volunteer of SAHAS, a city-based NGO.Rajnandini, a gay, is married with four children. He is settled in Ahmedabad. He said, "My wife knows about my sexual orientation. She supports me. I was forced to get married and my partner was also forced to get married recently."Nakshatra Bagwe, an actor and short filmmaker on LGBT rights from Mumbai, said, "Lots of people supported the event. Since such an event was being held in Gujarat for the first time, everyone associated with it put in lots of effort to make it successful. Hopefully, the event has been able to create some awareness among the residents about the issues that concern LGBTs."
