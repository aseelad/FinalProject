NEW DELHI: Vehemently opposing the decriminalization of gay sex, various social and religious organisation today contended before the Supreme Court that allowing such acts would lead to "horrendous" situation.Appearing before a bench of justices GS Singhvi and SJ Mukhopadhaya, they contended that homosexual behaviour is a disease, which should be cured through counselling and rehabilitation."It would be a horrendous situation in Indian society if it is allowed. The organizations (fighting for gay rights) should try to bring such people to national mainstream by providing counselling them," said senior advocate Radha Krishana, appearing for a Catholic organization.He said approving such acts is against the concept of family and marriage."India has got its own culture, tradition and custom. We cannot follow other culture. These things are being dumped in the country," he said.Other Christian groups, including Utkal Christian Council and Apostolic Churches Alliance too opposed the Delhi high court order which had in 2009 legalized gay sex between consenting adults in private.A Delhi-based social group Krantikari Manuvadi Morcha also opposed the high court verdict.The high court had in 2009 decriminalised gay sex as provided in Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and had ruled that the sex between two consenting adults of same sex in private would not be an offence.Section 377 (unnatural offences) of the IPC makes gay sex a criminal offence entailing punishment up to life term.
