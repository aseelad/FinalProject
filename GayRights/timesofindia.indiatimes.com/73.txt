LONDON: Equal rights for women and first official endorsement for gays will form the core of a historic charter - the 21st century's "Commonwealth Magna Carta ," to be signed by Britain's Queen Elizabeth on the Commonwealth Day on Monday.This is the first time that the Queen will lend support for gay rights in her 61-year reign. Around 41 of the 54 Commonwealth states still criminalize homosexuality.India is among a handful countries that don't consider homosexuality a crime. Same-sex relationships are recognised in only five Commonwealth countries: UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.The Queen has had talks with Commonwealth secretary-general Kamalesh Sharma over the issue of equal rights and will sign the document that says "equality and respect for the protection and promotion of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development, for all without discrimination on any grounds."
