Spanish singer Monica Naranjo was given the Maguey Prize over the weekend at Mexico's Guadalajara International Film Festival for her work on behalf of the gay community.

Hypocrisy still prevents people in many places from accepting public displays of love by same-sex couples, the singer said.

"The path is a bit more open now in Spain, but there is still a lot of hypocrisy, it is still not viewed well to have homosexuals walking down the street with their partner," Naranjo said.

The Spanish government has an "outstanding debt" with the gay community and needs to allowing single people to adopt children, the singer said.

Naranjo dedicated the prize to those who have been fighting "for decades" for gay rights.

The Guadalajara International Film Festival is screening a selection of gay and lesbian films.
