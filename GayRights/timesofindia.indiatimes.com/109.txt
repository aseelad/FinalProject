NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has criticised the Centre today for having a casual approach in the case relating to gay rights. It says when the constitutional validity of a section of IPC is under challenge, the ministries are filing affidavits without rendering any assistance on the legal issues. 



 Both the ministries of home and health had filled affidavits without taking a stand on Delhi high court verdict decriminalising consensual gay sex between adults in private.
