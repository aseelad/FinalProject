NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said on Thursday that it was disappointed with the Supreme Court ruling upholding section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that bans gay sex."The Supreme Court judgment thus criminalizes the personal behaviour of consenting adults," AAP said in a statement."All those who are born with or choose a different sexual orientation would thus be placed at the mercy of the police."This not only violates the human rights of such individuals, but goes against the liberal values of our constitution and the spirit of our times," it said.AAP said it hoped the Supreme Court would review the Wednesday judgment, which overruled a 2009 Delhi high court ruling, and that Parliament would step in to repeal the archaic law.The Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile, refrained from taking sides on the Supreme Court's judgment on same gender sex between adults, saying the government should consult all parties and frame a law."There is no need to be so disappointed. The Supreme Court has said the government can frame a law," leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj said in reply to a question on Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's statement on the judgment."Call an all-party meeting, draft a proposal. Just saying it is unfortunate won't serve any purpose," Sushma Swaraj said."We will react when we see the government's proposal. We cannot react to the apex court judgment," she added.Earlier on Thursday, Sonia Gandhi said she was "disappointed" that the apex court reversed the Delhi high court ruling on the issue of gay rights."I hope Parliament will address this issue and uphold constitutional guarantee of life and liberty to all citizens, including those directly affected by this judgment. We are proud that our culture has always been an inclusive and tolerant one," Sonia Gandhi said.The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that consensual sex between adults of the same gender was an offence, as held in Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. It set aside the Delhi high court verdict of 2009, which decriminalized sexual relationship between adults of the same gender under that law.
