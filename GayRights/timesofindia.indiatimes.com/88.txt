We all know that John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan play gays in Dostana! 

 

 Let's move on! And while these two actors are busy doing their own thing, it's Priyanka Chopra who is getting all serious and standing up for gay pride and all. She tells us, "Why should homosexuals be looked down upon or singled out? It's someone's individual preference... That's why I love the fashion industry. It's the only industry that doesn't discriminate, and encourages talent, whether you're straight or gay!" Must give it to Piggy Chops... She just killed two birds with one stone, eh? Yeah, she just promoted her two films with one quote. Wah, kya dimaag hai!
