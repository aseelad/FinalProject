NEW DELHI: A day before Delhi High Court pronounces its verdict on the validity of Section 377 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) that makes homosexuality a criminal offence, the government on Wednesday refused to spell out its stand on the matter, saying a "re-think" could not be ruled out.Though health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad preferred to keep quiet over the controversial issue, home minister P Chidambaram left the option of a re-think open.Chidambaram said PM Manmohan Singh had asked law minister Verrappa Moily, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and him to discuss and take a view on the issue of repealing Section 377."The meeting is being scheduled. We have a new government, we have new ministers, we have been asked to take a look at it and they can always bring new thinking on the subject and we still reach the same conclusion. But nothing prevents them from bringing new thinking to the subject," he said.About the government's stand, Chidambaram said an affidavit on the issue had been filed by the home ministry in the Delhi HC, which is hearing a PIL on the controversial issue. That is the position of the home ministry at present, he added.Azad, however, refused to say anything on the matter on Wednesday. Earlier, Azad had taken a different view from his predecessor A Ramadoss and called for a parliamentary debate and "wider consensus" on amending Section 377, saying there was need for a public debate on the issue.Ramadoss had favoured an amendment to Section 377. He had said, "Section 377 of IPC, which criminalises men who have sex with men, must go."Health ministry records show that men who have sex with men (MSMs) are posing to be India's greatest challenge in its fight against AIDS. National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) estimates that India is home to 2.5 million MSMs of which 100,000 are at high risk of contracting HIV due to multi-partner and commercial sexual practises.Meanwhile, the judgment either way would make news. That is, if the HC upholds the validity of the controversial section, it would cause a furore among gay activists and if it strikes it down, it would shock conservatives and even cause an uproar among the church and ulemas who see unnatural sex as anti-religious.
