The lovely Celina Jaitley is amazed at the response her blog on iTimes is generating in which she champions gay rights and argues for the amendment of the archaic Article 377 to protect minority communities. 

 

 "Thank you all those who support this human rights issue," the former Miss World writes in an update on her blog. "But what is really interesting to me is the humungous amount of antagonism towards me for showing my support towards the gay community. Believe me, it's not about gay rights... it's about basic human rights, about acceptance, about tolerance, about everything a human being (irrespective of their sex, caste, creed or colour) expects from parents, friends, society and most of all the LAW, which is our protector." 

 

 Reacting to the feedback she received through iTimes, Celina says, "A comment on my blog by Kevin Arnie from US really is wonderful. For all those who oppose gay rights or gay unions â€” how does the union or giving rights to a gay couple diminish your own? How exactly does it tear at the moral fibre of your diverse community? Doesn't being gay and straight, Hindu and Muslim, Southern and Northerner make you diverse in the first place?"
