Priyanka Chopra is on cloud nine.

After all, she thinks that Lady Luck is back favouring her special child all over again, what with the super success of Dostana and Fashion that has negated the series of flops that had come her way â€” you know the futuristic love story that hardly had a future, the large-canvassed Drona that proved to be feather-light at the BO, and then God Tussi Great Ho wasn't that great either! But all of that is behind PC. What the actor is excited about these days is Ashutosh Gowariker's What's Your Rashee? Why is she so gung-ho about it?Well, besides it being a good script, she also gets to spend a lot of (quality) time with beau Harman Baweja na... Arey, he's her co-star in the film! She obviously wasn't going to let go of such a chance, baby! But let's hope their rashee has something good in store for them... something that goes beyond their so-not-happening love story. It's Lovestory 2050 we're talking about, obviously!
