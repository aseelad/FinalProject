LONDON: A Brighton actor and a guesthouse owner will become UK's first same-sex couple to be married as soon as a new law comes into force on March 29.The new law will see Andrew Wale and Neil Allard take the wedding vow just after midnight in the Royal Pavilionâ€”where over 4,000 Indian and Gurkha soldiers were treated during the WWI.The selected couple will be wed free of charge in the magnificent setting. The couple will be able to invite 80 guests to join them. Brighton and Hove is the second most popular location in the UK for civil partnerships, with Westminster coming first.Under the new law, samesex couples married abroad under a foreign law and treated as civil partners will now be recognized as married coupples in England and Wales in March 2014. Same-sex weddings in some British consulates and armed forces bases overseas will be possible, and arrangements for same-sex weddings in military chapels will be in place from June 2014.Britain's deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: "Love is the same, gay or straight, so it's only right that the civil institution should be the same. March will be a real moment for celebration as same sex couples finally get the chance to express their love through marriage."UK estimates gay marriages could boost UK's economy by 18 million pounds a year-with hoteliers, florists, caterers and gift shops expected to benefit the most from this latest legislation.British ministers have also predicted that introduction of same sex weddings could lead to 3,000 more unions on top of the 6,000 civil partnerships a year.Gay marriages are currently legal in 13 countries.
