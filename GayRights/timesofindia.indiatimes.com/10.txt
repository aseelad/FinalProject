PHOENIX: Barriers to gay marriage fell on Friday in Arizona, Alaska and Wyoming following a series of federal court actions, in the latest in a series of legal victories for supporters of same-sex matrimony in America.In Arizona, US district judge John Sedwick wrote in a ruling made public on Friday that the state's restrictions on gay marriage were "unconstitutional by virtue of the fact that they deny same-sex couples the equal protection of the law."Separately, the US Supreme Court rejected a last-minute request from Alaska seeking to block a ruling by a federal judge that struck down that state's ban, and a US district judge overturned a gay marriage ban in Wyoming.But a state holiday in Alaska meant gay couples would not be able to apply for marriage licenses there until next week, nor were marriages expected to immediately proceed in Wyoming because the judge who struck down a state ban there also put his ruling on temporary hold to give the state time to appeal.The federal court actions would bring to 32 the number of states that allow gay marriage, if the Wyoming ban is not put on a more permanent hold by a higher court by October 23. Arizona's attorney general said he would not appeal because he had no chance of success.In Phoenix, partners Kevin Patterson and David Larance rushed to a county clerk's office after the decision and were swiftly married in a ceremony just outside the building."I'm just overjoyed, it's been a long time coming," said Patterson, who was a plaintiff in the Arizona case.Earlier this month, the US Supreme Court surprised observers by leaving intact lower court rulings that struck down gay marriage in five states. A day later, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Arizona, found gay marriage bans in Idaho and Nevada were unconstitutional.Arizona's Republican governor, Jan Brewer, lashed out at the federal court system over recent gay marriage rulings in a statement that called them disappointing and troubling."It is not only disappointing, but also deeply troubling, that unelected federal judges can dictate the laws of individual states, create rights based on their personal policy preferences and supplant the will of the people in an area traditionally left to the states for more than 200 years," she said in a statement.
