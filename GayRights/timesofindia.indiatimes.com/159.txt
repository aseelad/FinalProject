NEW DELHI: RSS has supported the Supreme Court order last week recriminalizing consensual sex among gay adults, endorsing the stand taken by BJP chief Rajnath Singh."We support the verdict of the Supreme Court and oppose any move to abrogate Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. We agree with the view of BJP president Rajnath Singh ," RSS spokesman Ram Madhav said, virtually shutting down the possibility of any rethink on the part of the BJP on the issue.Ram Madhav rejected the argument that the SC order marked an assault on the fundamental rights of the gay community. "There is no violation of fundamental rights. Nor do we consider gay sex to be natural sex," the spokesperson further said.He said it was for political parties to debate and decide whether gay sex should be de-criminalized. "Making laws and changing them is the prerogative of Parliament. But so far as we are concerned, our position is very clear. We support the SC," Ram Madav said in what will nudge the government to file a review petition in the SC against the verdict.Government had initially kept open the option of taking the legislative route to nullify the SC order which has been seen as a setback for the gay community's campaign for equality before law. But BJP's opposition makes the option tougher. While the government can still promulgate an ordinance to negate the SC order after Parliament adjourns on December 20, organizing support for the legislation which will have to be brought in Parliament in the winter session may prove to be a difficult job.While BJP and SP have openly opposed any move to decriminalize Section 377, there are others who hold the same viewpoint and don't seem enthusiastic about the moves government is considering. With parties likely to be more risk-averse in the build-up to Lok Sabha polls, government may prefer to file a review petition before the SC.
