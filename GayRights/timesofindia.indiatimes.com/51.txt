While Delhi slammed Bollywood for its stereotypical depiction of gay characters at last year's Queer Pride Parade, this year the message was meant for television.A placard that caught our attention had a picture of Salman Khan holding two cards - a king of hearts and a king of spades - with 'Homophobic mocks!!!
