NEW DELHI: For sexual minorities, the past five months have proved to be significant in their struggle for equality and justice. In this period, the country has seen two contrasting judgments by the apex court dealing with the rights of this vulnerable section of our society.In December last year, a division bench of Supreme Court overturned Delhi high court's order which decriminalized consensual gay sex in what has come to be know as the Koushal case. The SC held that Section 377 (unnatural sexual offences) of the IPC does not suffer from the vice of unconstitutionality and that the declaration made by the HC was legally unsustainable.Five months later, in the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) case, another bench of the apex court on Tuesday recognized the legal and constitutional rights of transgenders, including the right of the Hijra community to be denominated the 'third gender'.Interestingly, the SC has in the current order acknowledged that Section 377 has been used in the past to harass transgender persons and discriminate against them, but it steered clear of commenting on the constitutionality of the section, saying that the Koushal judgment had already "spoken" on the issue and that it was dealing with a different issue "pertaining to the constitutional and other legal rights of the transgender community and their gender identity and sexual orientation".The question, however, is whether the current order will have any impact on the curative petition filed before the SC against the Koushal judgment? "They have not trenched on (impinge or infringe upon) the judgment of Koushal in the NALSA judgment. However, the ratio (rationale) of SC in NALSA saying that gender identity and sexual orientation can be read into the Constitution is the basis for reopening Koushal," said Anand Grover, counsel for The Naz Foundation in the Koushal judgment.Anjali Gopalan, founder and executive director of The Naz Foundation Trust and petitioner in the Koushal case, also said that the NALSA judgment will help them in the Koushal case. "They talk about not denying rights based on sexual orientation. I hope it will have a positive effect on the petition," said Gopalan.While both judgments -NALSA and Koushal-broadly deal with the issue of rights of sexual minorities, there is a stark difference between the two. In the Koushal judgment, the court observed that though the HC relied extensively on the judgments of other jurisdictions to protect the rights of LGBT persons and those judgments were informative in relation to the plight of sexual minorities, yet "they cannot be applied blindfolded for deciding the constitutionality of the law enacted by the Indian legislature".The NALSA judgment, on the other hand, relies extensively on international human rights principles and judgments of other jurisdictions like Germany, Argentina, South Africa, United States, Hungary, Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand. "We have referred exhaustively to the various judicial pronouncements and legislations in the international arena to highlight the fact that the recognition of 'sex identity gender of persons', and 'guarantee to equality and non-discrimination' on the ground of gender identity or expression is increasing and gaining acceptance in international law and, therefore, be applied in India as well," it said.
