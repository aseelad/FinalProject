Hi, I am Celina Jaitley… a film star by profession and a gay rights activist by humanity. When I openly stood up for the human rights of sexual minorities, I got a whole lot of support from people all over the world; at the same time I have been accused of being a lesbian (which is all right) and, more importantly, scorned and abused for standing up for the sexual minorities’ rights. Before I begin I would like to explain my sexuality: I am a straight woman with a whole lotta balls!

I have created a community on itimes to stand up for equal rights for gay community 



I became a part of the world of glamour at the very young age of 16. And not only since then, but somehow from childhood I have had gay friends and have been a part of their agonies and ecstasies . It’s horrid… just like apartheid when your very existence is a crime and you are discriminated against just because of what you are.

One of the two people who were catalysts in my taking the gay rights issue to another level, was a transgender makeup artist who was 50-years-old and stood by me in my struggling days as a model and actor. He was like a mother to me, he gave me pocket money when I was broke, and even looked after me when I was ill. Thanks to him I became a Miss India. He sent my entry application and I went on to become a Miss Universe runner-up. He, too, suffered in the battle against society and underwent many heartbreaking incidents of gay-bashing before passing away in an accident two years ago. He, too, wanted to do a lot for the transgender community… and my makeup on my wedding day, which never happened.

The other person lived through the trauma of being in a relationship with a closeted gay (who went on to become one of my dearest friends) and who also passed away last year having been a victim of  depression and bulimia due to the stresses of being gay in a homophobic society. He was also a victim of gay bashing alcoholism and drug abuse and there came a point that despite his illness we couldn’t get him help; his family refused to accept the fact that he was gay and that’s what was causing it, because he couldn’t be himself. Well his family… they didn’t even know of the concept. Besides these two, I have had the love and friendship of many gay friends and my own gay employees who I feel I owe my support to. They all inspire me to continue doing this… I owe it to their love and memory.

The biggest hurdle in India (the world’s largest democracy) which stands in the way of gay rights is Section 377…  this law has been used to systematically persecute, blackmail, arrest and terrorize sexual minorities. Section 377 is also seen as an anachronism from a less tolerant era and health care officials struggling to contain India’s AIDS epidemic warn that it is constantly hampering their efforts to contact vulnerable groups. I would like to most importantly point out that the (Section 377) legislation was introduced by British colonial authorities and does not reflect on Hindu cultural values. Even a prince was not spared of people’s misunderstanding and misacceptance of gays in India.

In 2005, Prince Manavendra Singh Gohil from a conservative principality in Gujarat publicly came out as gay. He was quickly anointed by the Indian and world media as the first openly gay royal. He was promptly disinherited as an immediate reaction by the royal family, but they eventually reconciled. Since then, Prince Manavendra has even appeared at the Oprah Winfrey show. Then, in 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest said that he was Ã¢â‚¬Å“scaredÃ¢â‚¬Â to return to India for fear of discrimination. He said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Indian media has exposed me so much that now when I call my friends back home, their parents do not let them talk to me.Ã¢â‚¬Â

However, there are many gay tolerant countries and societies in the world. For instance Iceland, which is set to appoint the world’s first openly gay Prime Minister Ã¢â‚¬â€ a former flight attendant who rose through the political ranks to become a cabinet minister. Johanna Sigurdardottir, the island nation’s 66-year-old Social Affairs Minister, is the pick of the Social Democratic Alliance Party to lead an interim government. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johanna is a very good woman Ã¢â‚¬â€ but she likes public spending, she is a tax raiser,Ã¢â‚¬Â said Geir Haarde, who quit as Prime Minister partly for health reasons. Johanna entered politics through the labour movement, serving as a labour organiser when she worked as a flight attendant with Loftleidir Airlines Ã¢â‚¬â€ now Icelandair, in the 1960s and 1970s. She was first elected to Iceland’s parliament in 1978. She became a minister in 1987 and has held her current post since 1999. Despite her veteran status, many Icelanders regard her as a maverick and respect her work promoting the welfare of minority groups. She faces the difficult task of repairing the nation’s shattered economy and rebuilding public trust in the government. Icelanders are deeply angry at their government for not reining in the country’s banks and leading the once-prosperous nation into an economic nightmare.

But sadly in India, except for the glamour industry, gay people are looked down upon. I personally know of gay doctors, hotel professionals, even scientists and government officials who are terrified of the fact that if people at their work or their families come to know, hell will break loose. So they live a suffocating closeted life and carry on becoming victims of depression, alcoholism and drug abuse. On June 29, 2008, four Indian cities (Delhi, Bangalore, Kolkata and Puducherry) celebrated Gay Pride parades. These were the first in Delhi, Bangalore and Puducherry. About 2,000 people turned out in these nationwide parades. I joined my gay friends in this endeavour. Though not much is happening about gay rights, at least now that I speak much about it people are talking about it and the media has started showing support.

India needs to shrug off its colonial mentality and come out of its all-prevalent homophobia. It appalls and dismays me to see the attitudes of Indian people towards homosexuals/bisexuals Ã¢â‚¬â€ they’re subject to really insensitive jokes/comments and open derision. The whole tendency is to brush everything under the carpet Ã¢â‚¬â€ discussing sexuality or sexual health is a taboo even now. No wonder India is so afflicted with HIV/AIDS and the situation can only get worse if it keeps getting brushed under the carpet. An HIV-AIDS prevention organization, The NAZ Foundation, has sued to have Section 377 overturned but the case was rejected on grounds that Ã¢â‚¬Å“public moralityÃ¢â‚¬Â should Ã¢â‚¬Å“prevail over the exercise of any private rightÃ¢â‚¬Â. The petition is being heard again on appeal.

When someone tries to identify with the gay/bisexual community, people and friends say,  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sexuality is only one very small aspect of life. It shouldn’t define who you are.Ã¢â‚¬Â But what they don’t understand is THAT is exactly what the gay community is fighting for. People should understand that gays/bisexuals are normal too and just like any other human being. High time India got rid of that parochial law. The saddest thing is that not even the younger generation, whom one expects new vision and liberalism from, is very supportive… their idea of modernization (as a fan of mine wrote to me) is Ã¢â‚¬Å“working in multinationals and IT companies, experiencing their nouveau riches and playing with cellphones and drinking at barsÃ¢â‚¬Â.

I was most happy recently to relaunch Bombay Dost (India’s first gay magazine) along with Prince Manvendra and gay rights activist Ashok Row Kavi .The new Bombay Dost comes with the tag-line Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbolder than ever’ Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœboldness’ has to do with the forthrightness with which the LGBT cultural expression is showcased. The magazine is a standard bearer for the growing confidence and artistic alacrity displayed by India’s homosexuals, says Nitin Karani (gay rights activist).  I feel it eschews any notion of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthem and us’ and mirrors the inclusiveness that we would expect in a more egalitarian society. For a lot of people, gay identity consists of maybe a few behavioral traits, superficial characteristics or even psychological symptoms. For many it is merely a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsex thing’. Bombay Dost seeks to break out of these limiting notions. It is not just about sexuality or gender constructs, but about the people we adore, the lives we live, the cultural experiences that shape gay community Ã¢â‚¬â€ everything around and everything around them.

My advice to all people who want to support gay rights in India is:  Everybody thinks of changing humanity but nobody thinks of changing themselves…. change your attitude towards gay people from within and your support is shown.

I have come up the hard way with unwavering faith in my principles and always trusted my instincts. Due to personal reasons also this cause is very important to me. I don’t know how I am going to do it.. .but I know only one thing, and that is I am going to do it. I feel it’s not about gay rights … it’s about human dignity and human rights. Some one had to stand up and I did so.

Ã¢â‚¬Å“Take the first step in faith, you don’t have to see the whole staircase… just take the first step.Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬â€ Dr. Martin Luther King Jr

All iTimes members can join my petition to the health ministry to have Section 377 amended.
