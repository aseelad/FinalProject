BANGALORE: Archbishop of Canterbury Reverend Rowan Williams is known to be broad-minded, liberal and outspoken in his thoughts.As the Archbishop was about to rush in his car to a programme after the inter-faith dialogue at ECC concluded, TOI asked him what his view on gay rights was. Williams replied: "The answer to this question is a long one. But yes, I support gay rights as a personal and legal right in the civil domain."Dr Mani Chacko, director of ECC, said: "The Archbishop of Canterbury is broad-minded and liberal. It is true that he had proffered gentle criticism of the Pope's stand on the issue. But he and the Pope have a good working and personal relationship. The Archbishop and Pope were together at a recent programme and the Pope even stayed with the Archbishop."Asked whether it wasn't a rather serious difference of opinion and outlook with the Pope, and how they could get them to see things similarly, other church heads who were with Chacko said: "There may be a difference in opinion. But if heads of different religious traditions themselves can come together, why should it not be possible for two people from the same tradition to do so? They enjoy a very good relationship."
