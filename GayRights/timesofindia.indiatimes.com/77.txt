GUWAHATI: The only gay support collective group in the northeast inaugurated the 'Dialogues Lesbian Gays Bisexual Transgender Film and Video Festival' this weekend.The three-day event was organized as part of its initiative to create awareness towards the issue of gay rights and support for the community.Organized by Xukia, the initiative is the first-of-its- kind festival in the northeast which will screen over 10 movies and two collections of documentaries from prestigious international film festivals like the Dresden and Berlinale.The event that began on Friday has been organized in association with Sapho for Equality, Pratyay Gender Trust and Goethe-Institute / Max Mueller Bhavan Kolkata in collaboration with SAHRA, India."There is lack of awareness about the issue here and we will be working on that. We want to reach out to the people at the grassroots. There is too much social stigma attached to homosexuality and gay people fear to disclose them due to this," said Meenakshi Bujorbaruah, a founder member of Xukia."This film and video festival will be the first in the northeastern region and will in itself be a milestone in the LGBTQI history of the northeast. For the very first time a selected package of LGBTQI films will be travelling to the region from national and international film festivals like Berlinale and Dresden," added Bujorbaruah.In February, the group had organized the first gay pride march in the city, the first one in the northeast. It also led a protest march in the city against the Supreme Court's reinstatement of section 377 last December that recriminalized homosexuality.The collective group comprises mostly of young women who came forward last month to announce the formation of Xukia, the first collective organization in the state to offer support for the region's gay community. And the first step of the group was organizing the three-day film festival here and creating awareness about the issue.
