U.S. federal judge Vaughn R. Walker's ruling against a California ban on same-sex marriage has triggered applauses and criticisms from various groups in California and elsewhere on Wednesday.Growing Generation, America's largest surrogacy agency to assist members of the gay and lesbian community to create their families through surrogacy and egg donation, hailed the landmark ruling."This is a day we have all dreamed of and while our mission over the years has expanded to include all family types, this victory will provide the first steps at equality for our gay and lesbian families who are the foundation of our company's history," said Growing Generations Co-Owner Dr. Kim Bergman."Both gay and straight families can celebrate this victory as it makes the United States one step closer to true civil rights for all of its citizens," he added.Growing Generations Co-Owner Stuart Miller said: "As a gay father, I am so thrilled that the case went this way and the forward momentum it gives the cause for justice.""For all of the families we have helped create as well as all of the other gay and lesbian families, this will be a day that is remembered and celebrated for decades to come."Chief U.S. District Judge Walker of San Francisco found that California's same-sex ban, known as Proposition 8, violated the constitutional rights to equal protection and due process of two gay couples that want to marry.The lawsuit was brought by two same-sex couples after Proposition 8 passed in 2008, amends the California Constitution to deny same-sex couples the freedom to marry.The case has national ramifications as it will be appealed and eventually be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court creating the possibility of marriage equality for gay and lesbian families in every state in the United States.It will also provide critical rights and access to a myriad of federal benefits available to straight couples with children but denied to gay couples with children including federal pensions and social security benefits for spouses.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal filed two friend-of-the-court briefs in the case supporting the argument that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.
