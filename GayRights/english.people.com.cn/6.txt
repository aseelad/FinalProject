Same-sex marriage (also known as gay marriage) is marriage between two persons of the same biological sex and/or gender identity. On June 27, 2013, U.S. Supreme Court delivered a landmark victory for gay rights. According to recent report, same-sex couples will also be able to get married in England and Wales after new measures became law. More and more countries start to do something for gay marriage, such as what mentioned by Australia's New South Wales (NSW) Premier Barry O'Farrell "As a Liberal who believes that commitment and family units are one of the best ways in which society is organized, I support the concept of same-sex marriage."
