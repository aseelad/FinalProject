U.S. gay-rights advocates on Wednesday welcomed a decision by a federal judge in San Francisco to turn down California's ban on same-sex marriage.



U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled earlier in the day that California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, violates the equal protection rights of gay and lesbian couples by preventing them from being married.



Walker issued an order barring the enforcement of Proposition 8, which was approved by California voters in November 2008.



"Today's historic decision by the federal district court is clearly a milestone victory for all gay, lesbian and bisexual Californians, our families and our friends," said Lorri L. Jean, chief executive officer of the L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center. "But much more than that, it is a resounding affirmation of fundamental American ideals and core principles of the U.S. Constitution."



Same-sex marriage supporters were expected to gather in West Hollywood, Los Angeles to rally support for the ruling, gay-rights activists said.



In downtown Los Angeles, Latino Equality Alliance will hold a candlelight vigil later Wednesday as a show of support for "social justice."



In his ruling, Walker wrote that Proposition 8 "both unconstitutionally burdens the exercise of the fundamental right to marry and creates an irrational classification on the basis of sexual orientation."



"Proposition 8 fails to advance any rational basis in singling out gay men and lesbians for denial of a marriage license," Walker wrote. "Indeed the evidence shows Proposition 8 does nothing more than enshrine in the California constitution the notion that opposite-sex couples are superior to same-sex couples."



Proponents of Proposition 8 were expected to appeal -- likely all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
