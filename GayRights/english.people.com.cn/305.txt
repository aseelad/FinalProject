Built in the North Song Dynasty, Nanning Confucian Temple was the place for Confucian followers in ancient Nanning, and even a place for the old and young, especially the scholars to show their respect to the intellectual ancestors. The very original site was at Changxi Menwai Shashi (currently near Xiangyang Department Store), later it was relocated several times. In the 3rd year of Baoqing, the South Song Dynasty (1227 AD)ï¼Œit was moved to where Nanning Hotel is. However, only one Chamber of Great Success (Dacheng Dian in pinyin) was kept after the founding of People's Republic of China. In Oct, 1982, this Chamber was removed due to the extended building of Nanning Hotel.



Nanning Confucian Temple having a history of almost one thousand years was rebuilt at Shanglang Village, Qingshan Gardening, Nanning City in 2012.



It is the biggest Confucian Temple in Guangxi and even in South China, and one of the rare humanistic scenes in Nanning.
