Cindy McCain, the wife of 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, and their daughter Meghan have both posed for photographs endorsing pro-gay marriage in California.Cindy McCain appears with silver duct tape across her mouth and "NOH8" written on one cheek in a photo posted Wednesday to the Web site of NOH8, a gay rights group opposed to Proposition 8 which bans same-sex marriage.The McCains' daughter Meghan, who has been outspoken in her support for gay rights, also endorsed NOH8. She posted her picture in a similar pose to her Twitter page.Cindy McCain contacted NOH8 and offered to pose for the photo endorsement, according to a statement posted on the campaign's website. Meanwhile John McCain's office said in a statement that the Arizona senator respects the views of family members but remains opposed to gay marriage. "Sen. McCain believes the sanctity of marriage is only defined as between one man and one woman," the statement said.The NOH8 website praised Cindy McCain's willingness to publicly endorse a cause that is unpopular within the Republican Party."The McCains are one of the most well-known Republican families in recent history, and for Mrs. McCain to have reached out to us to offer her support truly means a lot," a statement on the site said. "Although we had worked with Meghan McCain before and were aware of her own position, we'd never really thought the cause might be something her mother would get behind. We have a huge amount of respect for both of these women for being brave enough to make it known they support equal marriage rights for all Americans."Meghan McCain said Wednesday in a Twitter message linked to her blog, "I couldn't be more proud of my mother for posing for the NOH8 campaign. I think more Republicans need to start taking a stand for equality."
