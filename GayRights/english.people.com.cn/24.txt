Spain legalized gay marriage Thursday in a parliament vote, overriding fierce opposition from the Catholic Church.

Spain legalized same-sex marriages on Thursday, becoming only the fourth country to do so after Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands and overriding fierce opposition from the Catholic Church.

Spain has become only the third country to do so after Belgium and the Netherlands.

The 350-seat Congress of Deputies, by a vote of 187-147 with four abstentions, approved the measure to give homosexual couples the same rights as heterosexual ones, including the right to adopt children.

The new law increases the chances of happiness for "our neighbors, our work colleagues, our friends, our relatives," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.

Activists jumped for joy and waved rainbow flags symbolizing the international gay rights movement.

Oscar-winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, who is gay, said 21st century families don't have to reflect the traditional Catholic model.

"I don't like marriage. I am not going to get married," he said. "But it is important for this to be called marriage so people know that it is the same thing for everyone."

The Netherlands and Belgium are the only other two countries that recognize gay marriage nationwide. The Netherlands lets gays adopt children. Belgium is considering the adoption issue.

Canada's House of Commons passed legislation Tuesday that would legalize gay marriage by the end of July as long as the Senate also passes the bill, which it is expected to do. Enditem
