Apple's Tim Cook Calls on Alabama to Protect Gay Rights ...The chief executive of Apple, Timothy D. Cook, challenged his home state, Alabama, to do more to protect the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, saying it was too slow to guarantee the rights of minorities during the civil rights era and that it was now too slow to ensure the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Mr. Cook’s comments came as he and seven others, including the University of Alabama’s football coach, Nick Saban, were inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor. Mr. Cook said Alabama and the nation “have a long way to go” before realizing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream of equality. Alabama is “still too slow on equality for the L.G.B.T. community,” said Mr. Cook, a native of Robertsdale. “We can’t change the past, but we can learn from it, and we can create a different future.” Alabama is among the states that do not recognize same-sex marriage, and it also does not offer legal protections on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
